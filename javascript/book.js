		text: "On the second Tuesday in June, the hottest day so far that year, Pax decided that she wanted nothing more than to dismember Dr. Ernest Giles using a dull landscaping tool and feed his head to the colonies of rats inhabiting New York City’s subway system. It took her approximately thirteen days and seven hours to reach this conclusion after arriving at the Public Library on 42nd and 5th to begin her summer job as a reshelving assistant. Pax did not typically condone acts of violence, but she was sure that if she asked around, she would find more than enough people willing to help.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				She remembered the first day she had started the job, nearly two weeks earlier- she had climbed the wide marble steps past a pair of enormous stone lions at 9:52 in the morning. Pax had gazed into the marble eyes of the lion on the left, thinking about how much better this job was than any of the ones her friends had gotten. Most, if they were lucky, worked the cash register in corner stores, or washed dishes in Italian restaurants. Typical crappy teenager jobs. <br/><span></span>\
				But the Library had been one of Pax’s favorite places since she was four and went to the sing-alongs featuring Snuffles the Friendly Stegosaurus in the children’s reading room with her brothers. So as she entered through the thick wooden doors that looked as though they should contain at least three dragons and a fairy godmother, Pax felt like she had won some small lottery. <br/><span></span>\
				She paused just inside the doors and discretely slipped off the sneakers she had traveled in and slipped on a pair of nicer leather flats to match her business casuals. The night before, she spent an hour going back and forth with Merrick about what to wear. Her brother hadn’t been terribly helpful, and merely offered things like “you look like a flamingo” and “what on earth kind of a color is azure?” but Pax appreciated the feedback regardless.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				That first day the front hall had been almost empty when she entered- the Library didn’t open to the public until 10 and even then it often started out slow. In the two-storied glow of the chandeliers, Pax could appreciate the shear magnitude of it. The main branch took up an entire city block and underneath her feet lay seven levels of infinitebookshelves, that end-to-end stretched on for miles. She wondered how many years it would take to read every single item cover to cover. <br/><span></span>\
				She approached the information desk, where an enthusiastic looking college age girl with bouncy blond curls beamed at her and “Good morning!” as though it was the best morning she had ever had the pleasure to wake up to. The girl wore a neatly pressed collared shirt in a delicate shade of peach and more makeup than Pax had cumulatively applied to her face in her life. <br/><span></span>\
				“Can I help you find something?” the girl pressed eagerly. “How about a map?” She presented Pax with a glossy paper map as though it were the key to the city of Oz.<br/><span></span>\
				“Um, hi,” Pax replied, feeling as though anything she had to offer would be a letdown by comparison. “I’m looking for Dr. Giles. I’m Pax- new reshelving assistant.”<br/><span></span>\
				The girl looked delighted. “Are you a new Page? That’s wonderful! I’m Tricia,” she said offering her hand and showing off her perfectly aligned teeth in another smile. “He would be at the reference desk, second door down the hall on your right,” she pointed. <br/><span></span>\
				“Thanks,” said Pax, wondering what a Page was and whether she was one. She turned and walked in the direction indicated. <br/><span></span>\
				On her way, she passed by a room with and open exhibit of nineteenth century law manuscripts. On the wall across from the stairs hung an oil portrait of a doughy-faced man wearing a maroon suit and a smug expression. Many more oil portraits followed, most depicting similarly dressed men with comparable expressions of smugness. But she forgave the decorators, because they were also kind enough to place brass lions in the drinking fountains and intricately carved marble everywhere else.<br/><span></span>\
				When she found the reference desk, she quickly identified what must be Dr. Giles even before she could make out the print on his immaculate silver badge. A man in a tweed grey suit was standing directly in front of the dark oak paneling, his hands crossed firmly over his chest and his pale eyes narrowed. Although couldn’t have been older than thirty-five, a bald spot shone on his forehead like a polished rock. But it turned out that what Giles lacked in hair, he made up for in malice.<br/><span></span>\
				He shook her hand briskly with an expression on his face as though her were swallowing a lime. “You’re less than ten minutes early,” he said by way of greeting.<br/><span></span>\
				“Um,” began Pax, while trying to fathom a reason why ten was the requisite quota of earliness for the New York Public Library. Giles saved her the trouble.<br/><span></span>\
				“If you had missed a train stop or the bus had been too full, you would have been late,” he said. He forcefully handed her a small silver pin of her own, imprinted with the name Pansophie Lebrun.<br/><span></span>\
				Before she could explain that she always traveled on foot and thus enjoyed a high degree of predictability in transit time, he had started on a long list of disallowed behaviors by the library, of which she was sure he had added a couple of his own choosing.<br/><span></span>\
				“—food is to be consumed only during lunch break in designated areas, never give a visitor the impression that he or she is allowed to leave with a resource, and you’ll have to wear another pair of glasses,” he finished. “Those are simply absurd.” <br/><span></span>\
				Pax wore a pair of large oval glasses that were an unapologetic shade of grape. The sides were studded with small red stones that she had absolutely adored when she was twelve and they were thick enough to make her eyes appear as though they were trapped behind a fish tank. Now at sixteen, she had to admit that they were several Vogues short of chic, but she could not easily afford to replace them.<br/><span></span>\
				“These are my only pair,” she said contritely. <br/><span></span>\
				Giles gave her a look of irritation, as though he was not in the mood to joke. <br/><span></span>\
				Further, he simply refused to call her Pax, which was every other human being, animal, and vegetable on the island of Manhattan had called her since she was two. <br/><span></span>\
				“Don’t be ridiculous, your name contains no trace of x’s,” he snapped when she first tried to correct him. “You’re working for the New York Public Library, not for Walt Disney.”<br/><span></span>\
				Before she was able to point out that essentially every nickname in existence added either y’s or b’s and doubled consonants, and what was the matter with the humble, under-loved letter x if one wanted to make use of it, he directed her to a cart laden with so many books, a Belgian draft horse would be necessary to displace it.<br/><span></span>\
				“I trust you know what to do from your training,” he said. “I’ll have you sort through these and report back in an hour. It takes the average reshelver forty-four minutes to get through a stack like that, but with you I’m afraid that would be foolishly optimistic.” <br/><span></span>\
				And with that he was off down the desk, no doubt to shave the icing off of children’s birthday cakes. She felt vaguely irritated at happy blonde Tricia at the information desk for failing to warn her. She also wondered what training he was referring to, and wondered if that had something to do with being a Page. <br/><span></span>\
				Glancing down the reference desk, she saw another man working at the other end. He was older, with peppered hair and a tightly clipped beard, and he wore a moss green sweater vest with a brown velvet bow tie. The ensemble gave him the look of an aging history professor. Pax tried to make eye contact but he was preoccupied, searching the computer systems for a serious looking woman standing in front of him with a briefcase.<br/><span></span>\
				Pax sighed and turned to the cart next to her. She experimented with trying to move it, but it was like pushing against one of the marble pillars. Glancing around, she saw another empty cart on the other side of the desk and deciding she probably didn’t need permission, she quickly grabbed it. One of the rear wheels was a little loose but it would do. She pulled the new cart up next to the immovable one and started pulling out the books by room.<br/><span></span>\
				Shelving was as simple as placing things in numerical order, and Pax progressed through her piles with alacrity. But there were enough books on the cart to start a whole new library, albeit one focused mostly on maps, early European history, and Jewish studies. <br/><span></span>\
				An hour crept by, with Pax falling into hazy daydreams. She wondered about the contents of each book, and the lives of those who had read and returned them. She wondered if anyone had wondered about her when she had returned items in the past.<br/><span></span>\
				It took three trips to reach the last book, a Wine and Cheese Atlas of Germany, before she pulled up to the reference desk again empty-carted. More people had crowded around the desk since she last left, waiting for the attention of one of several librarians now working there. Among them, she recognized the grey tweed of Giles.<br/><span></span>\
				He apparently noticed her too and his eyes narrowed. After scratching something down on a piece of paper and handing it to the man he had been helping, he strode over and stood in front of her, glaring. <br/><span></span>\
				“What on earth possessed you to take the reference cart?” he hissed. Pax guessed the only thing that kept him from actually yelling was the fact that they were in a library.<br/><span></span>\
				“Dire necessity,” she responded, and then immediately wished she hadn’t. <br/><span></span>\
				Giles’s face turned the color of an old newspaper and he spoke in a lower, even more dangerous voice. “If you think this is a joke, Pansophie, then perhaps you can make other arrangements for your summer.”<br/><span></span>\
				“That’s not what I meant,” Pax corrected quickly. She needed the job quite badly to help with the apartment. “Sorry, I just meant that the cart was too hard to push.”<br/><span></span>\
				“Did it even occur to you to ask?” From the tone of his voice, one would have though that Pax borrowed the cart and accidentally killed someone with it. <br/><span></span>\
				“I-” Pax would have said she tried, but that sounded stupid. It was just a cart. Surely in a library the size of an entire city block there were more than two carts.<br/><span></span>\
				“And you’re not wearing your badge.”<br/><span></span>\
				She had forgotten to put it on. Her hand went to her pocket and pulled it out.<br/><span></span>\
				“Maybe you shouldn’t bother,” he said snidely. “Clearly this position is too much to handle for a teenage girl.”<br/><span></span>\
				She racked her brain for what could possibly make him dislike her to such an obtuse degree, and all she could think of was her age. So far, most of her coworkers appeared to be several years older and were perhaps more permanent fixtures.<br/><span></span>\
				Pax had just turned sixteen. She was only here because the head librarian had been a close friend of her mother’s, and had suggested the position to her father. Perhaps under Giles’s long list of things he found distasteful, which no doubt included such items as sunshine and golden retriever puppies, nepotism appeared with a capital N. <br/><span></span>\
				She pinned on her badge, thinking about how much she wanted to instead shove it up one of his nostrils.<br/><span></span>\
				“Ten minutes for lunch,” said Giles, “and when you come back—” he let the sentence hang ominously. He strode back over to his position behind the reference desk and smiled politely at the next woman waiting. She glanced over at Pax with curiosity. <br/><span></span>\
				Incensed, Pax walked as fast as she could to the break room. Giles was being completely unreasonable and she knew that employees were typically given a half hour for lunch. <br/><span></span>\
				She was so absorbed in her thoughts that she nearly opened the door labeled “Staff Only” into the face of someone standing right behind it. The boy jumped back with a small yelp of surprise.<br/><span></span>\
				“Watch out,” she said, more irritably than intended.<br/><span></span>\
				The boy raised his eyebrows. “Sure thing, partner,” he said. He was also young, probably still a high school student. His brown eyes, after their initial surprise, were crinkled into a teasing grin. <br/><span></span>\
				He was also dressed rather strangely, as though he were off to play a tambourine in a boy band on the pier. A small tan fedora sat perfectly straight on top of his dark curly hair. Instead of the neat clothing of everyone else she had encountered so far, he wore a pair a tattered jeans and a white t-shirt that bore a picture of a polar bear and said ‘Save the Humans’ in dark blue lettering. According to what Giles had just described, he was completely out of dress code.<br/><span></span>\
				“What’s the matter?” he challenged. “Not the right sandwich flavor?” He indicated the brown bag she was holding tightly in her fist.<br/><span></span>\
				“No, sorry,” she said and sighed. “I only have ten minutes. Eight now,” she said, consulting her cheap runners’ watch. Pax threw her bag down on one of the two tables and sat. <br/><span></span>\
				She was now inside a cozy stone chamber that was crammed with way too many badly worn couches, a tiny television, and a table bearing a coffee pot and the oldest looking phone that Pax had ever seen. It had a disk that turned for each number, and it wasn’t entirely apparent which end was meant to be spoken into. A library catalogue computer was attached to the wall under the only framed picture in the room, one of a curly haired, pudgy faced woman wearing a countess’s coronet and holding a poodle. Someone had thoughtfully added a mustache.<br/><span></span>\
				The boy came to her table and sat down as well. He opened a bottle of water and took a long, contemplative swig. “Lebrun,” he said, eyeing her nametag. “You related to Nik and Merrick Nero by any chance?”<br/><span></span>\
				“They’re my brothers, she said, pausing before her first bite of sandwich. “How do you know them?”<br/><span></span>\
				“Nik’s in my history class and I know Merrick from the swim team. So you’re his twin?”<br/><span></span>\
				“You swim?” she asked in surprise. The boy was not particularly tall or athletic looking.<br/><span></span>\
				“Used to,” he corrected. “I did the 100 meter back with Merrick. He said he had a twin named Pax.”<br/><span></span>\
				“Yep, that’s me,” she said through a bite of her sandwich. She even looked like Merrick; she had always been on the tall side, and her freckled face was framed with light brown hair cut very short. They both had hazel eyes, though Merrick had the sense to pick glasses that weren’t purple.<br/><span></span>\
				“But it says Pansophie-”<br/><span></span>\
				“Forget what it says on the nametag.”<br/><span></span>\
				He shrugged. “Brian,” he said offering his hand. <br/><span></span>\
				Pax took another bite of her sandwich as she shook it. She didn’t have the time to be formal. In another three minutes she would have to walk back. <br/><span></span>\
				“Are you late for a funeral?” he asked as she wolfed down the rest of the sandwich and procured an apple.<br/><span></span>\
				“Not unless it’s my own,” she replied. “I just started as a reshelver and a librarian named Dr. Giles is on some sort of crusade against me.”<br/><span></span>\
				Brian let out a snort.<br/><span></span>\
				“Giles has a vendetta against anyone working here with anything less than a master’s degree. He feels it undermines the serious nature of library science.”<br/><span></span>\
				“That’s ridiculous,” said Pax. “A monkey could reshelf books if it had a tall enough ladder.”<br/><span></span>\
				Brian gave a wry smile. “You’d think so, wouldn’t you. We monkeys free up the people with masters degrees for actual important work.”<br/><span></span>\
				“You reshelf too?”<br/><span></span>\
				“I’m usually downstairs, in the stacks,” he said. “Closed to the public. Today they’re short up here though- I’m filling in for someone in Maps.”<br/><span></span>\
				Pax nodded her head slowly, thinking. She had always wanted to go down into the stacks. Seven underground stories filled with more books than most people could fathom. <br/><span></span>\
				“But don’t let Giles get to you,” Brian said. “He nearly punched me once as a Page when I refused to take off my hat.”<br/><span></span>\
				“What did you tell him?” asked Pax, impressed that Brian could have gotten away with such an open act of defiance.<br/><span></span>\
				“I told him I wore it for spiritual reasons.”<br/><span></span>\
				Pax grinned. “And why do you wear it?”<br/><span></span>\
					Brian considered her and his eyes grew unfathomable, as though there was suddenly an ocean between them. “Let’s stick with spiritual reasons,” he said evenly.<br/><span></span>\
				Pax didn’t know what to say to that, but her time was nearly up. She crumpled her paper bag into a ball and threw it into a small wire trashcan next to the table with the ancient phone. <br/><span></span>\
				“Wish me luck,” she said on her way out.<br/><span></span>\
				“Break a leg,” Brian responded. “Or better yet, break his.”<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				The rest of the afternoon was miserably spent making photocopies of old returns records and addressing envelopes to be sent off to the other branches. Giles breathed heavily down her neck the entire time, filling the air with vapid comments. She did her best to ignore him but that only seemed to annoy him further.<br/><span></span>\
				“I see your parents never bothered to teach you the courtesies of civilized response,” he said, when she failed to address his comment about the proper folding of paper for envelopes. “You could probably be outwitted by the stapler.”<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				She had gone home that first day at eight in the evening, half relieved that she hadn’t been fired, and half wondering whether it might have been better that way. Maybe washing dishes at an Italian restaurant wouldn’t be so bad so long as no one was watching over your shoulder criticizing the frothiness of your soapsuds. <br/><span></span>\
				Yet Pax was not easily cowed and for the rest of the week, she turned up at precisely 9:49 each morning, saying a quick hello to Tricia as she changed her shoes. She did not see Brian again and assumed he was back down in the stacks. She tried to swallow her jealously as she shelved monumental piles of books, stapled pieces of paper that no one would read, and reminded three hundred tourists that there was no flash photography in the reading rooms.<br/><span></span>\
				Giles reminded her on a daily basis how unwelcome she was. He enjoyed critiquing her performance and pointing out her flaws, and the more people present to hear, the better. <br/><span></span>\
				But despite Giles, she really did love the library, with its marble floors and papery smells, and atmosphere of untouched history. She loved to pretend that the thick covers and spines of the dusty volumes held the centuries-old secrets of alchemy and divination. In place of the oval light bulbs in the chandeliers, she imagined that real candles and lanterns hung above on heavy iron chains, illuminating the dusty volumes from on high with a waxy incandescence. <br/><span></span>\
				Instead of tourists, with their boisterous voices and their startling array of unseasonal footwear, robed and hooded academics glided across the bookshelves that lined the walls and bent low over the wooden tables, discussing the majesty of the natural world in hushed voices. <br/><span></span>\
				Of course she never did see them, but imagined they hid just out of sight, perhaps wandering the stacks below or tucked into hidden alcoves in the marble. She sometimes whispered to them when she was particularly bored, and on several occasions she thought she heard them whisper back. <br/><span></span>\
				However, she mostly encountered the tourist sort. They did not want to discuss the treatises of Aristotle and Kant, but instead wanted to know where the bathroom was located, was it always this hot in New York, and which restaurants were good if one had a four-year-old, a seven-year-old and a budget of ten dollars a person. <br/><span></span>\
				Really, I’m not a concierge, she wanted to tell them but she didn’t because that would have delighted Giles to the point of tears. Instead she smiled politely and showed them the sign indicating the bathroom or pointed out that summer started June 21st, or said “there is a McDonalds on the corner of 40th and Madison, why don’t you try there?”<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				On this particularly hot afternoon in her second week, Giles came up to her at the long oak returns desk with an expression of malicious satisfaction. Clearly he had been hoping to needle about something and she was not disappointing him.<br/><span></span>\
					“Pansophie!” he snapped in a voice that was so angry it was almost happy. “Why are the Roman books still up here? This light is awful for the binding, as I told you twenty seven minutes ago!”<br/><span></span>\
					Pax repressed her sigh. “I was just waiting for the pile to grow a bit larger,” she said. Really she had forgotten, but Giles didn’t need any more ammunition. <br/><span></span>\
				“I probably need to give them a bit of a going over,” she added. “You should have seen the dirty hands of the woman who just returned them.” Giles hated dirt in the way that a normal person hates terrorists.   <br/><span></span>\
					But her attempt to align them against a common enemy failed. Giles’s chest expanded as though he had just inhaled three Mylar balloons’ worth of helium. His bald spot flashed dangerously in the ceiling lights. “There will be no insulting patrons on my watch, Pansophie! If you want to remain a member of this Library-” he said ‘Library’ as though it was a holy place containing the souls of his ancestors “-then you better get those books to the rare books room, or I will be discussing this incident with Holmes.”<br/><span></span>\
					Holmes was the head librarian who Pax had never met, and Giles had already threatened to fire her on twelve separate occasions that week. She made a concentrated effort not to roll her eyes and she rose with a decisive slowness to do his bidding.<br/><span></span>\
					With a curt nod, the man bustled off to the other end of the long desk where Pax heard him exclaim “Daniel! Do I have to remind you again to leave a quarter inch margin when you staple? These are very near a half inch!” He pulled out a wooden ruler from his pocket and bent over the cowering Daniel.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				Pax might have finished the day off with no more incidents had it not been for the book on Japanese dynasties. <br/><span></span>\
				She was reshelving in the Rose Room, the magnificent high ceilinged hall adorned with frescoes of the cloudy blue heavens, when a woman approached her. She had dark hair that was almost black, which she had twisted into a tight bun at the nape of her neck. Her hawk’s nose gave her a very severe look that was matched by her black eyes, and she was an inch shorter than Pax. When she spoke in a low murmur, her voice had the traces of an accent that might have been Russian.<br/><span></span>\
				“How much for the bouk?” she asked, holding up a book. It was a leather-bound copy of The Last Dynasties of Feudal Japan and its sides shone with a metallic silver sheen. A royal blue silk ribbon protruded from the middle, marking the page of some previous reader. <br/><span></span>\
				“No sorry,” Pax responded in hushed tones. “They’re not for sale.”<br/><span></span>\
				“Not for—?” The woman appeared confused.<br/><span></span>\
				“These books,” Pax said, pointing around the room, “Do not leave the library. If you’re interested, you might find a similar item in the shop downstairs, or you can check something out of the other branches.”<br/><span></span>\
				“But it is not for me, for you,” said the woman, looking sternly at Pax. <br/><span></span>\
				“Okay, right,” said Pax. “You can leave it with me then.” Thinking the woman wanted it reshelved, Pax tried to take it, but the woman tugged it sharply away. <br/><span></span>\
				“No, no,” she said. “I take it for you.”<br/><span></span>\
				Pax was thoroughly confused. “Fine, but don’t let it leave the library,” she told the woman. “When you are done, kindly return it to one of the front desks.” Having done her duty, Pax wheeled her cart to the other side of the room, leaving the woman standing and clutching the book. <br/><span></span>\
				She spent the next half hour in the children’s reading room, where someone had checked out every kid-friendly book on kangaroos the library owned. When she returned to the reference desk to see to her next task, she nearly turned around and walked straight back to the children’s room. Giles was standing there, apparently waiting for her, with an expression on his face that could have boiled lead. <br/><span></span>\
				“Tell me, girl,” he spat. “What appears to be your problem?”<br/><span></span>\
				“What do you—?”<br/><span></span>\
				Giles glowered at her so severely it looked though he was trying to inflict physical harm. He reached for the desk next to him and drew out the leather bound copy of The Last Dynasties of Feudal Japan. Its sides shimmered like a clouded mirror.<br/><span></span>\
				“A woman was trying to carry this out of the library. When asked she said it was for Pansophie Lebrun.”<br/><span></span>\
				The Russian woman must have ignored her warning and read her nametag. Pax opened her mouth in protest. “I told her, no books-”<br/><span></span>\
				“This is a rare text. And what on earth do you mean by this?” he said, with venom in his voice. He briskly opened the book to the page marked by the blue silk ribbon. Oddly, it was completely blank except for a hand written message in a shiny black ink.<br/><span></span>\
				Kind greetings Pansophie,<br/><span></span>\
				 Congratulations for I am your correspondent and have chosen you to conduct inquiries through careful observation. If it has not yet happened, be patient for it soon will. Please note your questions on these pages and do keep in mind, it becomes less clear before the routes reverse.<br/><span></span>\
				“What is that? Correspondent?” Pax was baffled, but Giles was so overcome with rage he didn’t appear to notice.<br/><span></span>\
				“Writing on a rare manuscript,” said Giles through gritted teeth, “is utterly abhorrent. Not only are you a worthless employee, but you actually deface priceless library property.”<br/><span></span>\
				“I didn’t write that!” said Pax indignantly. People were starting to look at them. “It’s addressed to me.” She almost added ‘you idiot’ but caught herself.<br/><span></span>\
				“Pansophie, that will be all from you today,” he said. “For every day as far as I’m concerned.”<br/><span></span>\
				“You can’t possibly— I didn’t do that! Whoever did should clearly never be allowed in here again.”<br/><span></span>\
				Giles ignored her. “I will be sending a bill to your home address for the damages. Along with your last paycheck.”<br/><span></span>\
				“But-”<br/><span></span>\
				“You may leave now,” he snapped, his eyes flashing. A small group of Chinese tourists were staring. One of them took a picture. <br/><span></span>\
				Pax could see she would get nowhere with him, so she spun around and marched out of the hall. She was not about to pay any bill, she couldn’t pay it. And Giles didn’t understand but she needed a job. Certainly there would be someone she could talk to who would listen, perhaps the friend of her mother’s, though she was not sure she was still up to working with Giles in any capacity.<br/><span></span>\
				Mind racing, Pax grabbed her bag from the break room and quickly dove into the employee bathroom to change out of her work clothes and into gym shorts and a t-shirt. She replaced her ill-fitting leather flats with sneakers. Pausing at the mirror she pulled as much of her short brown hair as she could grab into a pathetically small ponytail and pushed her purple glasses up the bridge of her nose. Twenty-three and a half blocks separated the Library from her apartment and she had never been one to waste an entire hour’s worth of pay on transportation. <br/><span></span>\
				Once outside and past the cool stone gaze of the north lion, she set off at a light jog, her bag strapped tightly to her back. She wove in and out of pedestrians, trashcans, and fire hydrants. Her reflection matched her pace on glass windowed department stores for the first several blocks until those stores turned into closely spaced apartments with crooked doors and rusting fire escapes, and corner shops boasting sale prices on bread and cigarettes. In the sudden heat of the coming summer, the streets smelled like car exhaust and hot garbage.<br/><span></span>\
				She was passing the Silver Lotus Chinese Restaurant on 9th Avenue when a dark figure came bursting out of an alleyway and collided with her head on. The air went out of her chest and she just managed to maintain her balance, skidding to the side of the road. Her collidee was not so lucky. He hit the curb with the force of a stack of books, and let out a forceful umph.<br/><span></span>\
				At second look, he was a teenager with very short blond hair and pale skin. Despite the hot day he was wearing a black blazer with pants that looked laser cut to his size and on his wrist hung thick gold watch that looked as though it could cost more than her apartment. He had a black leather backpack that had fallen next to him, and he snatched this as he heaved himself off the ground, refusing her help. <br/><span></span>\
				“Watch where you’re going,” he said angrily. His hands were turning slightly bloody and his face was scratched. <br/><span></span>\
				Collisions were an inevitable, approximately tri-annual occurrence for Pax on her runs and she was usually apologetic, but this kid had been asking for it. She narrowed her eyes at him.<br/><span></span>\
				“Sorry,” she said, sounding rather un-sorry.<br/><span></span>\
				But the boy was already moving away, his gaze travelling quickly up and down the road as though he was afraid of pursuit. Seeing no cars coming he dashed across the street, a little dizzy but otherwise seeming unhurt. Pax followed him with her gaze until he ran into another alleyway and vanished. <br/><span></span>\
				That was bizarre, she thought. But she had encountered all sorts in the city and it certainly had not been the most unusual thing she had ever witnessed. Pax took up her jog again, though her thoughts kept returning to the boy and whatever he had been running from.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				After twenty-three and a half blocks across town she slowed to a halt in front of a door marked by an overhanging sign in the shape of a dachshund. It was difficult to make out the peeling yellow letters but she knew they read “Nero-Lebrun Veterinarians on 61st.” <br/><span></span>\
				A small cardboard sign hanging in the dusty window informed her that the office had closed an hour ago but she ignored this and entered. Bells jangled welcomingly as she pushed the door inwards, though their noise on the door’s return was drowned out by a small chorus of barks, sounding like a badly tuned orchestra.<br/><span></span>\
				At the cramped and overflowing front desk sat an older man. His skin was heavily lined and his nose twisted slightly to the left, as though god or someone had knocked into his face while clay was still drying. The tufts of his remaining hair were a stark and almost luminous white, and they stuck out from his head at all angles, as though a child had pasted them on. When Pax came in, he glanced up from the receipts he was sorting. <br/><span></span>\
				“Hello Merrick,” he said in a wheezy voice as he scratched at a ledger with his pen.<br/><span></span>\
				“Oh come on James, my hair isn’t that short, is it?” said Pax, walking closer. She pulled the hair that hadn’t already escaped out of its tiny ponytail, allowing it to form a sweaty brown wreath around her face. <br/><span></span>\
				The old man put his pen down and looked up at her again, squinting as though she were directly in the path of the sun. After a second, recognition flashed across his pale eyes and he nodded.<br/><span></span>\
				“Sorry dear, my eyesight is going. Need to get me some of those,” he said indicating her thick oval glasses. <br/><span></span>\
				“You can have mine if you want to get me a new pair,” she said. <br/><span></span>\
				James chuckled. “Purple’s not my color. Goodness, the two of you look remarkably alike. Though you are a bit prettier, I suppose.” <br/><span></span>\
				“Don’t tell Merrick that, it would hurt his feelings,” she said as she let herself behind the desk and looked around for the clipboard of overnight patients. <br/><span></span>\
				“Where is that boy anyway?” James asked as he continued his work, scratching things on slips of paper that needed to be ordered.<br/><span></span>\
				“No idea,” she said, though if she had to guess, she would probably say swimming. Merrick seemed determined to match the mileage of the Pacific Ocean by the end of the summer.<br/><span></span>\
				Pax located the patient list, which had migrated from its usual place by the phone to sit by the tank containing a piece of plastic seaweed and a single goldfish named Jupiter. <br/><span></span>\
				She took the clipboard into the back room where she was faced by two rows of dog cages and one wall lined with cats. The dogs greeted her with varying degrees of enthusiastic tail wagging based on their level of health. Altogether they resembled a badly defeated army. Many wore plastic cones around their heads like helmets and several had bandaged limbs or rib cages. <br/><span></span>\
				One of them, a small fluffy white thing with overly large eyes and a spiteful expression yapped assertively at Pax as she drew near. <br/><span></span>\
				“I don’t think they’ve heard you yet in Brooklyn,” she told it, grinning as she opened the first cage and drew out the water bottle. “Maybe try a little louder.”<br/><span></span>\
				The small dog readily obliged. <br/><span></span>\
				Pax went down the line one by one, changing out waters and giving the dogs pats on their uninjured patches of fur as she went along. Two of them had X’s marked next to their names, meaning they were potential biters, so she skipped petting those. <br/><span></span>\
				She repeated the same procedure for the cats. On these occupants, her presence was much more polarizing. Some of them brushed plaintively against the bars mewling and purring. Others retreated to a back corner of their small cage to stare at her with mistrust through eyes of amber and jade.<br/><span></span>\
				When everyone had been watered, Pax stepped through a pair of double doors into a small adjoining room to prepare the food. That room housed some more unusual occupants. <br/><span></span>\
				A cage by the door contained a squirrel missing half its tail. Next to it sat a parakeet with mottled feathers and in a small pen on the floor, a chicken pecked at corn kernels. In the corner of its pen, a small straw nest contained an enormous brown egg. She wondered if that was someone’s idea of cross-species incubation. <br/><span></span>\
				In a tank by the window, a bearded dragon bathed under a heat lamp. It had some sort of yellow paste over what looked like a series of puncture wounds.<br/><span></span>\
				“The Robinson’s Labrador tried to pick it up, thinking it was a toy,” said a voice directly behind her. <br/><span></span>\
					Pax spun around, surprised. “Hi Dad,” she said. Aaron Nero stood in the door, a pair of blue examination gloves twisted into his left hand and patient file clutched in his right. He wore a yellowing lab coat that was slightly too big for his thin frame, reinforced at the neck by a stethoscope. His hair was closer to black than that of his children, except for where it was streaked with grey. His hazel eyes exuded a sort of sad calmness, like an old basset hound whose owners had moved away and left it behind.<br/><span></span>\
					“It’ll have scars for a while,” he said, speaking again of the lizard, “but it should be completely fine.”<br/><span></span>\
					“That’s good.”<br/><span></span>\
					He nodded and considered her thoughtfully. “You can tell me why you’re home so early later at dinner,” he said. “Merrick’s at swim practice, and I’m sure it’s a harrowing tale that he wouldn’t want to miss.” <br/><span></span>\
					She nodded sheepishly. “Absolutely thrilling, yes.” <br/><span></span>\
					He looked at her again, as though trying to read the story from her face. <br/><span></span>\
				“There are some new pigeons upstairs as well,” he said, then turned and walked back down the hall as though that was an appropriate conclusion to their conversation. <br/><span></span>\
					“Good, Rolex could use more exercise,” she told his retreating back and heard a low chuckle in response.<br/><span></span>\
					Pax went through the list and scooped out portions of kibble into rubber bowls. Here and there she would add a supplement if it was marked next to the name, powders and bottled medicines that gave the room a light mineral smell. As she worked the chicken made soft cooing clucks and shuffled around in its wood shavings. It didn’t seem terribly concerned about sitting on its egg. <br/><span></span>\
					She was doing the last cat on the list when the dropper to the high calorie cat food additive broke, dowsing her hand in a greasy brown liquid that smelled vaguely of fish. She wrinkled her nose in disgust and grabbed a towel from next to the parrot’s cage to mop up the mess. The liquid had gotten all over the bowl as well so she started over with a fresh scoop of cat food. There was still plenty of smelly liquid left in the bottle for another round if she got a new dropper.<br/><span></span>\
				They kept extra droppers in the drawer nearest to the door, but when Pax reached in the packet was empty. She pulled it out, hoping to find another behind it but her hand met a small wooden box instead. <br/><span></span>\
					Curious she put the bottle down and removed the box from the drawer. It was about as large as a lunch box and looked as though it hadn’t been touched in years. It had a simple metal clasp that was slightly stuck but it came loose with a bit of coaxing. <br/><span></span>\
				Peering inside, she saw a haphazard assortment of papers the size of index cards, all aged to a light tan. The papers felt oddly thin, as though they contained less matter than normal paper. Most of them had dates and times written in a loose script, and some noted a name or an item, but otherwise they were completely blank. <br/><span></span>\
				Tori, 14th November<br/><span></span>\
				Alec Erkle, globe, 29th June<br/><span></span>\
				tea pot, date not specified<br/><span></span>\
				Perhaps they had been old employees or clients, nothing of particular interest to her. She was about to put the box back when she saw something poking out from one of the corners. Buried under the papers was a small velvet jewelry box, about the right size to contain a ring. It was the deep rusty color of dried blood, and traced into the top in a swirling gold monogram were the letters A. M. L. <br/><span></span>\
				Adrienne Monique Lebrun. <br/><span></span>\
				Cat food forgotten, Pax lifted the red-velvet case out of the box with trembling fingers. Pax and Merrick had been seven when their mother died, but Nik had been older. Nik said that she used to smell like vanilla and sing as she washed the dishes but Pax struggled to remember. He said she used to tell stories about a group of adventurers called the Seven Strangers. He remembered when their father wore his happiness in his eyes, and how it would stay there all day. Nik said that their parents used to stay up late into the night staring at the blank television screen talking, and their father would make Adrienne laugh.<br/><span></span>\
				But Pax didn’t remember. It was as though a different person had known her mother and passed along an annotated photo album with bits and pieces left out. Anything she retained was like a badly played game of telephone, a jumbled secret that grew more muddled the longer it was kept. Pax didn’t remember the vanilla. She only new the name of one stranger (Robin). But now part of her mother was here, in this small wooden box, buried among these words and numbers, contained in the red velvet case.<br/><span></span>\
				Her hands shook slightly as she removed the little case and pried it gently apart. It opened with a snap and a small puff of dust to reveal a black cloth-padded interior. Inside was not a ring however, but a long silver chain. On the end of it, where a jewel or charm might be, hung a perfect silver disk about the size of a penny.<br/><span></span>\
				While the chain was slightly tarnished to a black tinge, the disk looked as though it had been cleaned yesterday. It shone like a small silver moon and was completely smooth except for miniscule numbers etched around its edge- one through twelve like a clock. She flipped it over expecting more, perhaps the hands of a clock, but the rear side was blank.	<br/><span></span>\
				Unable to help herself, Pax picked it up. To her surprise, it felt slightly warm, as though someone had just worn it and returned it to the case the second before she opened it. She turned the disk over in her fingers and let the chain slide through her hand like water. After a moment’s hesitation she undid the clasp and slipped it around her neck.<br/><span></span>\
				As the clasp closed, she felt something like a breeze whoosh over her, and for a moment she was afraid the parrot had escaped, or perhaps the chicken. But then, small splinters of light started to erupt from the disk of the necklace, as the numbers began to light up one by one, each flash separated by a couple of seconds.<br/><span></span>\
				It reached the number two and Pax stood rooted there, wondering whether there was some hidden battery compartment inside. The disk was was very thin so she rather doubted it. <br/><span></span>\
				It reached four and Pax wondered if that was a crack in the egg in the chicken’s pen, or was she just imagining it. She was probably imaging all of it.<br/><span></span>\
				The number six erupted into light and Pax thought she heard voices rushing through her ears. Or was the air conditioning broken? Should she take the necklace off?<br/><span></span>\
				At eight she could see it, there was definitely a small fissure running down the length of the egg, though the chicken was unconcernedly pecking away at bits of corn. But she couldn’t look at the egg- her eyes were drawn back to the necklace as though magnetized. <br/><span></span>\
				At nine something happened to her vision. Shapes clouded into and out of view. Objects multiplied as if her vision had doubled several times, or as though she had suddenly sprouted multiple pair of eyes like a spider. She tried to tear the necklace off but found that her hand was stuck in place, holding the disk at eye level. She tried to call out for help but her tongue was glued to the top of her mouth.<br/><span></span>\
				At eleven, she was positive that it was not the air-conditioning that was broken. Voices rose and fell around her like waves breaking against a beach. <br/><span></span>\
				“—and perhaps you could explain to Margaret that—”<br/><span></span>\
				“—incongruence lies in the fourth down from—”<br/><span></span>\
				“Well hello sister—,” they called.<br/><span></span>\
				Pax stood transfixed. The illuminated face of the disk with eleven bright numbers was the only thing that appeared clear and focused in the haze of the room when the number twelve suddenly burst into light. <br/><span></span>\
				The entire necklace then glowed brighter and brighter, blazing spots into her vision, until she actually felt the metal heating up. It was becoming painfully hot, so hot she was sure it was burning her. She wanted to scream, to tear it off but that was impossible, her hands were trapped in tar and the air in her lungs had turned to styrofoam. <br/><span></span>\
				The voices roared in her ears speaking over one another and talking so quickly she couldn’t make out the words. It grew louder and hotter and more confusing until it was so deafening she thought her eardrums might burst and voices would erupt through the walls. <br/><span></span>\
				But even over the roar she heard one loud distinctive crack, splitting through the energy in the room as though a gavel had been banged and a judgment had been passed. And in that instant the world shifted around her.<br/><span></span>\

vegetarianism = {
	guess: Math.floor($(window).width() * .27),
	text: "The house was made out of real adobe so of course there used to be real Indians living in it, though right now it was lived in by my Great Uncle J and his fourth wife who I think was my aunt but also not. There were lots of parked cars around and cars still pulling up to the real adobe house which I don’t think the Indians would have liked on account of it probably scaring away their horses.<br/><span></span>\
			It was my first time in New Mexico and the cars belonged to a lot of people I had recently found out I was related to though I could never remember just how, because third cousins was an obfuscating concept. Mrs. Lancey would have said to draw a concept map with lines of different color markers to understand it better but Mrs. Lancey liked concept maps more than any other person in the world and probably had concept maps to help her with dry-cleaning and choosing a breakfast cereal in the morning. I just liked markers.<br/><span></span>\
			“There’s the little princess!” said Uncle Dave when I entered onto the real adobe floor, though I don’t think he was actually my uncle, just a third or fifth cousin’s dad pretending. He had grey hair- no uncle in my family had grey hair- and he smelled like leather and mouthwash as he leaned in for an obligation hug. Mrs. Lancey had just taught us about DNA in biology section last week and I wondered how many nucleotide base buddies two people could have the same ones of and still be considered family.<br/><span></span>\
			I went by the door that contained Shadow and told it “Hi Shadow.” We weren’t allowed to see or touch Shadow because once Shadow had “Nearly took a child’s thumb clean off!” said Uncle J with a big grin, though this was sad because the thumb had gotten infected and had to be shortened. I think that having a shortened thumb would have been a really bad thing so I was a bit afraid of Shadow but also a bit lonely for him. I pictured him all fuzzy and sitting right there on the other side of the door, triangular ear laid against the wood as he wondered about all of the petting he was missing and the butts he wasn’t able to sniff. “I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry,” he said in his whiny dog voice, a little globe of apologetic drool running down from his weird black dog lips. “I won’t eat thumbs any more, I really did not enjoy the taste.”<br/><span></span>\
			There was a help-yourself buffet set up on the kitchen counter and third cousin Sarah was eating a hot dog right out of her hands with no plate. Hot dog crumbs could easily drop on the real adobe floor, which would have really upset the Indians that used to live here because everyone knew that hotdogs weren’t real meat and Indians liked things that were natural. Hotdog crumbs would have been an abomination to their spiritual vibe and probably their ancestors too. <br/><span></span>\
		I got salad first and because I wasn’t rude like Sarah I used a plastic plate with a cactus on it, and a fork because that was civilized and I was a cultivated young flower, said Uncle J. <br/><span></span>\
			Uncle Ben, who was also probably not my real uncle but I couldn’t remember how he was related to me, came and sat down. Actually no, this wasn’t Uncle Ben, this one had a weird bumpy boil with hair on it coming out of his chin, and his name was something like Don or Jonny or maybe it was William. Anyways where were all the aunts?<br/><span></span>\
			“What are you doing eating rabbit food like that?” he asked. His cactus plate was loaded with a saucy steak that looked as though it had only recently stopped bleeding, and a lump of shapeless cornbread. “Your not vegetarian or nothing, are you?”<br/><span></span>\
			I was still caught up in trying to remember his name and alleged relation and I also happened to really like rabbits. They were my third favorite animal after lions and miniature horses, falling right above golden retrievers on the totem pole. I mentally apologized to Shadow so he wouldn’t be insulted by my animal preferences on top of being locked away in a room for biting a kid’s thumb off. But I just shrugged and didn’t answer Uncle Whoever-He-Was, and from that moment on I became a vegetarian.<br/><span></span>\
			Vegetarianism is tougher than it looks, especially when you are seven and your parents are too old to understand anything. When I finally hugged good-bye to every person in the state of New Mexico, I left for the airport with my grandma to go back to Pennsylvania where my parents live with my hamster, Doug. Pennsylvania has no adobe houses but it used to have real Indians too except they lived in wood houses which are no longer around.  <br/><span></span>\
			The first trap to befall a vegetarian, if it’s not pepperoni pizza in the airport, is definitely chicken noodle soup. Even if it doesn’t have actual pieces of chicken flesh floating in a miraculous broth with slippery noodles shaped like the alphabet, there are most certainly dead animals in that bowl. Probably at least three hundred of them. <br/><span></span>\
			“What’s wrong with you?” asked Mom when I had spelled out Doug’s name twice without eating any of it. <br/><span></span>\
		I explained to her that I was a vegetarian and could not longer eat dead animals. Soup was a type of dead animal, said the ingredients list.<br/><span></span>\
			“Why’s that?” asked Mom, her voice the same amount of suspicious as when I tell her I need two desserts because I got one hundred percent on my spelling test.<br/><span></span>\
			“Rabbits,” I said. It was hard to explain so I did not waste words, but I had never been convinced of anything so strongly in my life, except that me and Sean McGahan were going to get married and have four children some day. I didn’t tell this to Mom because I don’t think she would have understood the comparison. Though perhaps a concept map would have done it.",

orchard = {
	guess: Math.floor($(window).width() * .27),
	text: "Today was an Autumn Picnic Day, which meant that Violet and her mother and their mostly-for-decorations basket would go to the orchard to visit their special apple tree. Her mother would pack the basket with strawberries and walnuts and jam on rye bread and would bring flowers for the tree too because the trees in the orchard apparently liked flowers a lot.<br/><span></span>\
			“It’s an Ozark Golden tree,” her mother had told her when she asked which apple tree was theirs. <br/><span></span>\
			Violet was not sure what an Ozark Golden was but apples were bad, because of souls and because of God. <br/><span></span>\
			In fact they were so bad that you rotted right up if you even touched one. Marty from school bragged that he picked one up once even though she knew it couldn’t be true and he was a liar. But he bragged all around until his parents found out and then she didn’t see him for a while after that.<br/><span></span>\
			 Apples were bad and so were peaches and oranges and pears and anything else that grew in the orchard. Except they were also good, said her mother. They were prayerful.  <br/><span></span>\
			“Remember Violet, you have to be prayerful today,” her mother had said that morning as she braided a blue ribbon into Violet’s hair.<br/><span></span>\
			But it was really hard to be prayerful on such a beautiful day. She held her breath as they walked down the path of heavy-laden fruit trees, just in case their rottedness got at her. Her mother did not need to hold her breath as much because she was bigger and smarter and the devils knew that they could not get her so easy. <br/><span></span>\
			Violet unheld her breath with a happy puff when they got to the big patch of grass on the hill by their Ozark. <br/><span></span>\
			She took out her horses Buttercup and Blacky from her skirt pocket and pranced them along the ground. Both were made of wood and Blacky was painted black. Buttercup was not painted anything but Violet did not hold this against her. <br/><span></span>\
			Both were legendary horses from sunken Spanish ships coming to the British Isles except that today they were Moorland ponies captured by a band of nice Indians. <br/><span></span>\
			This made Buttercup and Blacky very happy so they went and had an Indian dance all the way down the hill. Then it was time for training and hunting and spirit healings.<br/><span></span>\
			Mother had said not too far, but Mother did not understand how much horses needed to exercise. <br/><span></span>\
			They were in a darker patch of apples that were much closer neighbors and Buttercup and the Indians were helping to rescue Blacky, who had gotten his hoof caught in a snake’s mouth when she saw something moving in the shadow of a nearby tree. Something with hair and hands that was wearing brown pajamas, though Violet couldn’t tell if it was a boy or a girl. <br/><span></span>\
			He, she, or it. She decided on it. <br/><span></span>\
			Blacky was having heart spasmings on account of the poison when she saw that the it was picking apples off one of the trees and putting them in its pajama shirt. <br/><span></span>\
			Violet dropped Blacky and she suddenly felt queasy, like her jam sandwich was decidedly unhappy. But she watched with a sick-feeling fascination as the it gathered up more apples. Perhaps the it didn’t know about the rotting or maybe the it was an angel and such things were all right. <br/><span></span>\
			But then the it bit into the apple it was holding with a skull-smashing crunch and Violet nearly screamed in shock. Her stomach felt like when Mr. Kleiffer came over and cut the throat of their pig Jennifer last November and blood had gotten in a big red puddle all over the dead grass before he took a coffee can and caught the rest in there.  <br/><span></span>\
			Blacky couldn’t contain himself anymore and neighed out of nervousness. The it looked up in surprise and dropped one of the apples. It had a face like a demon with mud on it, and its body, about her bigness, was strangely pointed. Blacky didn’t like being looked at so Violet agreed they should all run away as fast as the wind. While they were running back, Blacky and Buttercup played beauty contest. <br/><span></span>\
			“Violet, where did you go?” her mother scolded when she cantered up to their Ozark.<br/><span></span>\
			“There’s an it over there,” said Violet as she blinked up at her mother.<br/><span></span>\
			“A what?”<br/><span></span>\
			Violet shrugged. Blacky had just won the talent section by singing opera and Violet wondered how Buttercup felt about that. “Like a person but also not. And very dirty.” <br/><span></span>\
			Violet was not allowed to be dirty. It was disrespectful to God. <br/><span></span>\
			“It was touching lots of apples. It ate one.” She felt her eyes widen, remembering the crunch.<br/><span></span>\
			“Don’t be ridiculous,” said her mother, but she glanced over at the patch of fruit trees Violet had just exited. With a huff, she gathered her skirt and rose off the blue-squares blanket.<br/><span></span>\
			“Stay here,” her mother said.<br/><span></span>\
			Like usual, Blacky and Buttercup got married, this time by the Indians, and then had three babies. Two of the babies were bread crusts left over from lunch and the third was a pebble. She named this one Rocky. <br/><span></span>\
			The babies had a beauty contest while she waited for her mother to return.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			The September evening was cool and Violet was safely home and fed, and Mrs. Pritchet had called a town meeting. The thought of that soul-eating creature being so close to her dear little Violet, why it could happen to any of their children!<br/><span></span>\
			She had discussed with Brother Frederick and he had agreed completely. Let us gather together as a body united, he had suggested in his blissful voice. See what there is to be done.<br/><span></span>\
			So she had called and they would come, because the people of Downing loved Mrs. Pritchet. They simply adored her. <br/><span></span>\
			She had not in fact been born in Downing but after marrying William when she was just eighteen, the two of them moved into the little stone house by the creek, with enough room for one sow and a small flock of chickens, and plenty of room for a handsome little boy to run around. A delightful assortment of blackcurrants and strawberries grew like little gems all along the pebbled shoreline, and Mrs. Pritchet had quickly taken to jam making, to supplement her candle-making and knitting.  She had been unbearably pretty then, her blond hair hung in soft curls to the middle of her back. She was still unbearably pretty but mostly wore her hair pinned back. <br/><span></span>\
			And then after William— well Violet had only been two and she only 24. With his passing, the people of Downing had taken it upon themselves for their young mother.<br/><span></span>\
			She would do her rounds each season with a basket full of jams, exchanging a seasonally filled jar and a smile for the latest news. She liked to stay informed. For instance, Mr. Ducket had just purchased a new thoroughbred mare to better his breeding stock, Kathryn Wilcroff was pregnant with the baby of her husband’s brother, and Sally Greenby had tooth rot and likely would not be in attendance tonight.<br/><span></span>\
			They were starting to arrive, shuffling into the wooden benches of the narrow room and chatting in lowered voices, their dear faces full of vacant concern. How they came when she called!<br/><span></span>\
			“My beloved residents of Downing,” she paused to let the words ring through the wooden room. Her residents. Hers. “Just this afternoon my daughter and I took our lunch out to the orchard, on our annual visit to the apple tree where my beloved William−” but her voice caught in her throat and she paused. <br/><span></span>\
			Someone, she thought it was Jerry Glaser, coughed politely and she recovered and went on.<br/><span></span>\
			“Little Violet went off to play in the fruit trees while I sat in prayerful rest, but the child came back shrieking and crying just ten minutes later, wailing that she had seen something awful. I tried to calm her and then immediately went to investigate. Sure enough, by the Johannes’s grove of Macintoshes, there it was. A small grey demon-like being with eyes completely black and with bones for fingers and nasty tangled hair. It shuffled among the trees like a bat and cast multiple shadows. And not only was it picking the fruit, it was eating.”<br/><span></span>\
			Cries of shock issued from the townspeople on the benches. <br/><span></span>\
			Pleased, she continued, “I shouted at it to be gone and leave the blessed trees, but it did not appear to understand. Thank goodness dear Dr. Glen was out on a stroll and heard my shouts, or who knows what would have happened? He advanced, brandishing his walking stick like God’s very scepter and the thing dropped the stolen apples and peaches and ran away.”<br/><span></span>\
			Dr. Glen rose to speak. He was a young, eager man with thick brown hair that stuck to the sides of his face like the bark of a tree, and only carried a walking stick to prevent early onset rheumatics. “I’m ‘fraid it’s true, every word,” he said. “It looks as though some poor creature has been taken by the devil and changed into a demon o’ sorts.”<br/><span></span>\
			Murmurs went around. A demon in their orchard. Why theirs and not that of Marchville or Wingle? What was to be done? <br/><span></span>\
			“Friends, I know this comes as a shock, but Downing can and will act,” Mrs. Pritchet said in a soothing voice. “We must expel it, or eliminate it.”<br/><span></span>\
			Heads bobbed up and down like a sea of toy boats.<br/><span></span>\
			“Let us decide upon a course of action,” she went on. “This town has been a home to me and my Violet, and its orchard has become our orchard. We need to protect it for it could be your trees, dear friends. It could be your children.” <br/><span></span>\
			Several of the women raised their hands to their chest.<br/><span></span>\
			“My little Thomas said that he saw a monster moving in the trees when we were out for a walk last Tuesday, and I told him he was talking nonsense. The poor child was right!” cried plain-faced Anne Uhlhorn from the front. <br/><span></span>\
			“I heard about something like this happening in Yitterby ten or so years back, offered Jerry Glaser. “A group of disturbed youth decided to pillage and desecrate that orchard for food. A really nice one that is in Yitterby, very old.”<br/><span></span>\
			More clucks from the audience. Yitterby was a distinguished town, known for its longwooled sheep breeding. Why hadn’t they heard of this? If it could happen in Yitterby, it could happen anywhere!<br/><span></span>\
			“What did they do?” asked Miss Eva, a gracefully aging lady who lived by herself in a cottage near the schoolhouse. Yes, aging quite gracefully, but Mrs. Pritchet would age better. <br/><span></span>\
			“A nice public hanging of eight out of the eleven scared off the other three real quick,” responded Jerry Glaser. “Haven’t had any problems since.”<br/><span></span>\
			 “What does the law say, Sheriff?” asked Dr. Glen, turning to a scruffy man at the back of the room with a shabby brown coat and a pistol tucked into his belt.<br/><span></span>\
			“Well, er-” He looked distinctly uncomfortable as forty odd faces turned in his direction. “The law does not intervene on matters of God,” he mumbled, shooting an uneasy glance at Brother Frederick. “The orchard is out of my jurisdiction, beyond the perimeter guards who dutifully protect it.” <br/><span></span>\
			Brother Frederick rose with a balletic solemnity and all extraneous murmuring died away. He was not old but his head was shaved to a peach-like austerity. <br/><span></span>\
			“Children of God,” he said, his ceremonial voice inviting them all to bask within its divine aura. Mrs. Pritchet was all but envious of his aura. <br/><span></span>\
			“We have a duty to protect what we hold sacred, and moreover a duty to protect our fellow men. This is neither the first nor the last time our souls will be tested.”<br/><span></span>\
			The entire room appeared to hold its breath.<br/><span></span>\
			“Yet,” Brother Frederick went on, eyes half closed and face uplifted, “Who are we to shed fresh blood on those who lie beneath the trees? First we must discover the truth, and then forgive or seek justice.” He nodded solemnly again and then very slowly took his seat, as though being lowered on a litter borne by angels.<br/><span></span>\
			The townspeople sat for a moment in awed silence. Mrs. Pritchet wasn’t sure what it was he had, that quality she often tried to imitate.<br/><span></span>\
			 “I suggest, dear friends,” she said, “that we monitor the situation closely to ensure it goes no further and assemble a team of volunteers willing to take action, if that becomes necessary. Let us keep all of Downing’s children safe.”<br/><span></span>\
			Dr. Glen, Miss Eva, Jerry Glaser, and Mr. Lockwood all volunteered. Other members of the town offered advice and opinions and made it known that they would stand behind her. Anything to keep the orchard safe, they said. They would be on watch.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			September swept into October and the trees grew heavy with their offspring. Macintosh, oriental pear, nectarine, golden crisp, gala, ambrosia, candor peach− most fell unbidden to the earth. Saplings rose briefly from the seeds to discover that their parents had already robbed them of light. The frosts of November would slay any that dared remain. This was the way of God, reflected Mrs. Pritchet. The yearly gift of the trees to those who lay beneath. <br/><span></span>\
			Yet not all the fruit was making it to the ground. The townspeople frequently went for walks through the orchard, or sat on benches to read, or else came to place flowers at the sacred roots, but this year everyone felt the presence of a malign entity. Those who saw it shouted prayers of banishment or threw heavy rocks. It was growing larger, they said. Sustained on that which was never meant to sustain it.<br/><span></span>\
			Mrs. Pritchet had been accustomed to taking Violet on weekly strolls down the winding paths, pointing out the names of the flowers that people had deposited at the base of each fruit tree. “Asters, lilies, gerberas, hyacinths, roses…” But now she was reluctant to go back lest her daughter be affected by that presence. <br/><span></span>\
			Her band of volunteers began to plan ways of trapping it, and Jerry Glaser took to carrying his hunting revolver whenever he went by the Orchards, but the creature countered by visiting earlier, closer to dawn. <br/><span></span>\
			One of the perimeter guards saw it fleeing as he took up his post at daybreak on a frosty November morning: the wavering form “of a child,” as he described it, limping as it disappeared to the east. After that it was not seen. The wind had torn the remaining fruit from the trees, taking the leaves with it. Nothing left over to plunder.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			One cold afternoon after a day of school with Miss Eva, Violet was making a pie out of leaves for her family: five children named Susan, Todd, Kathryn, Jane, and Violet the Second. Todd wasn’t eating his proper share and he had to sit and say extra prayers after dinner and go to bed with no story. <br/><span></span>\
			She went to the window and asked Mother if she wanted maple leaf pie but Mother said, “Don’t be foolish,” she returned to knitting a grey something that looked like a tent for fairies.<br/><span></span>\
			Violet felt not at all foolish and in fact felt rather like an excellent cook. Susan and Violet the Second had seconds and thirds. But Mother had been odd since the day of the it and the Ozark golden apple tree that was actually her father but he was in heaven too. <br/><span></span>\
			Mother said the it was bad, very bad indeed, and that they couldn’t return to the orchard until it was gone. That was perfectly fine with Violet because the orchard was big and confusing and extremely full of souls, but the problem was, their yard was too small for a growing lady who needed to practice running and climbing and flying off trees.<br/><span></span>\
			It was “Time for dinner,” said Mother, so Violet fed the rest of the pie to the squirrels. They ran away but would be back later, she was sure. She washed her hands extra hard to get all of the sinful dirt off, and planned what she would pray about for dinner prayer. It was good to be planned. Violet decided to pray for snowflakes, and for princess Elizabeth to come and visit, and for the poor children, and especially Julian in school who stuttered on “d’s” and “w’s” and a couple other letters that Violet couldn’t remember. <br/><span></span>\
			At dinner, Mother talked about how Mr. Lockwood’s cart broke down today, and wasn’t that awful? and how Miss Ella’s new dress came in with a purple trim instead of canary, wasn’t that silly of the designer? Violet nodded but really she was happy the canary was okay. She decided she didn’t like Miss Ella. <br/><span></span>\
			When Mother wasn’t looking, she slipped her slice of bread down the front of her dress. She had tried a couple weeks ago to put pieces of chicken down there too, but Mother had complained about where all the grease was coming from, and did Violet grow up in a barn? After dinner she slid some teacakes in as well, because those weren’t greasy only sticky, and stick didn’t show as much. Only three teacakes today, but she was trying to beat her high of six.<br/><span></span>\
			There was time between dinner and bedtime to play, so she took Blacky out and galloped him from one side of the house to the other, making sure she didn’t step into quicksand. Buttercup had a sick hoof since yesterday so Violet had wrapped it in an old sock and Buttercup was lying down to rest it. It would be better tomorrow probably or maybe next week. <br/><span></span>\
			Too early, Mother came in for bedtime and told Violet a quick story about the fox who wanted a piece of cheese from a crow and made him drop it, because the crow wasn’t smart and also wasn’t a good singer. It was a bit confusing but it was also really funny.<br/><span></span>\
			When Mother left, Violet took the bread and teacakes out from where they were hidden behind her pillowcase and threw them out the window. She hoped three teacakes would be enough. <br/><span></span>\
			Sometimes the it left her things too, like pretty rocks or bits of metal twisted into shapes. Her favorite was a brown horse, just like Blacky and Buttercup but made of fabric, not wood. It had probably belonged to someone else first but now it was hers. She found it a couple of weeks ago on top of the wall next to the tree where the squirrels lived and knew who had left it for her. She called this one Apple because that was its favorite food.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			Mrs. Pritchet could plainly see that it was a bad influence on Downing. Bad falls, broken cart wheels, and lost wedding rings followed those few who encountered it like winter followed autumn. <br/><span></span>\
			In December Mr. Ducket’s new thoroughbred slipped on a patch of ice and broke a leg, and had to be shot in the head. Nobody had seen it but they all knew who was to blame.<br/><span></span>\
			In January, Miss Eva reported a stack of new siding gone missing. <br/><span></span>\
			“I was going to have Anthony patch up the walls around back,” she explained when Mrs. Pritchet came around with a vanilla scented beeswax candle and an ear waiting to be filled. Miss Eva had her silvered hair drawn into a puffy bun, which on top of her rounded spectacles gave Mrs. Pritchet the impression that she was conversing with a Great Grey owl. <br/><span></span>\
			“Then I hear scraping in the night and something cackling like a devil,” said Miss Eva shaking her head. “I tell myself, you silly old thing, it’s just your imagination, but I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone. All of the siding, gone!”<br/><span></span>\
			“Oh my,” said Mrs. Pritchet. She had another sip of tea. <br/><span></span>\
			“That thing needs to go,” said Miss Eva darkly.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			 “It has a nest down by the communal dump,” said Sally when Mrs. Pritchet came around. Sally had finally spat out her bad tooth over a piece of extra viscid treacle and had almost regained her ability to talk normally. The beeswax candle that was handed to her was slightly crooked and the wick was frayed in the middle but Sally would never point that out. <br/><span></span>\
			“Robbie’s gone an’ checked it out,” she said, still moving her lips rather gingerly on the left side. “He says it’s taken bits of cloth and pieces of wood an’ sorta lumped everything together.”<br/><span></span>\
			Well that explained where Miss Eva’s siding went, and Mrs. Pritchet had not seen her blue checkered blanket since she hung it on the line back in October.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			That winter, it seemed that more people were sick than in most other years. Nine people had died already including Anne Uhlhorn’s father and Mr. Lockwood’s infant niece. They would have trees in the spring.<br/><span></span>\
			Dr. Glen called together a small meeting to discuss the problem. Mrs. Pritchet volunteered her kitchen, and watched through the window as little birds pecked hopelessly away at the frozen ground.<br/><span></span>\
			“Nobody’s seen it in a while, but if it’s there now we should get it,” said Jerry Glaser. “Don’t give the thing a chance to get started in the spring.”<br/><span></span>\
			Dr. Glen nodded. “It’s probably snapping down the orchard’s trees for firewood as we speak.”<br/><span></span>\
			Mrs. Pritchet sucked in sharply. “What a horrid thought! Why would you even say something like that?”<br/><span></span>\
			“It was taking nectarines from my Uncle Dave’s tree,” said Miss Eva. “I wouldn’t put it past it to add branches to its nest.”<br/><span></span>\
			“We’d best put it out of its misery,” said Dr. Glen. He leaned wearily on his walking stick, as though it helped him bear the weight of Downing’s sick souls.<br/><span></span>\
			“And for all the misery it’s caused us−” Miss Eva shook her grey head. <br/><span></span>\
			Mrs. Pritchet thought carefully as she pulled the steaming kettle off the stove for tea. It would be better, safer, to have it gone. They could have their spring picnic and she would tell Violet all about Grandmother Pritchet, and maybe this time the child would remember. <br/><span></span>\
			“Next time it acts we take it out, and it’s still there in the spring we do something,” said Mr. Lockwood.<br/><span></span>\
			The faces around the table nodded grimly, and Mrs. Pritchet bobbed hers once in acquiescence.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			Yet spring came with no sign of it. The grass grew green and long, and families returned to their serene contemplations and prayer walks and picnics in the orchard. The aromatic haze of fruit blossoms rose in the air like a chorus, and the illnesses and worries of the winter seemed to recede further with each passing sunrise. Some of the blossoms would never make it into fruits in Downing’s northern climate, but all of the trees bloomed in this initial return to life.<br/><span></span>\
			Violet had grown two inches over the winter and needed new clothes, so Mrs. Pritchet busily set herself to lengthening the child’s skirts. And it was good to get the child out and about again; she was growing overly fond of teacakes and Mrs. Pritchet did not intend for her daughter to end up looking like poor Lillian Mayes’s child.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			In April, Brother Frederick declared that “God’s will had triumphed through the perseverance and strength of heart embodied by the good folk of Downing.” This pronouncement was greeted with wholehearted approval.<br/><span></span>\
			Even the men who periodically carted waste to the dump saw no sign of it. The string of misfortunes had ended− Kathryn Wilcroff gave birth to a healthy baby boy who would grow up thinking its father was its uncle, and Mr. Ducket was looking into another thoroughbred. There was no need to worry.<br/><span></span>\
			In the orchards she and Violet walked through rows upon rows of blossoms. The apple flowers emerged from their bulging pink hearts, the plums and peaches stared from their purple-eyed centers, and the cherry blossoms were bunched on the branches like clumps of snow. Side by blessed side, an expression of the beauty in God’s creation and the life that comes from death. <br/><span></span>\
			They passed other walkers and each time Mrs. Pritchet would nod beatifically at them. Your mother wishes you the best dear child, the nod said. <br/><span></span>\
			Each time they reached an open area of grass, Violet would let forth a peculiar pant as though she were short of breath, and Mrs. Pritchet wondered whether she was asthmatic. What a handicap that would be! She would have Dr. Glen check on her.  <br/><span></span>\
			But her daughter would grow to be lovely, the loveliest in Downing. Such a sweet disposition too. When the ladies came for tea on Sunday afternoon, six-year old Violet curtsied to all of them in her light blue dress before holding up the littlest bowl and offering in her cherubic voice: “Would you care for any sugar, Mrs. Dreswick?” <br/><span></span>\
			How the ladies had cooed. She knew they were absurdly envious.<br/><br/><span></span>\
			\
			In late June, the two of them went to visit Grandmother Pritchet’s cherry tree. It had been unseasonably hot of late so Mrs. Pritchet decided to go early, and packed each of them a twisted bun and a handful of strawberries for breakfast in her jam basket. The dawn was foggy but she could see the sun struggling to appear over a grove of fruitless tangerines in the east. <br/><span></span>\
			Violet was growing wider awake as they reached the cherries and trotted along slightly ahead. Grandmother’s cherry tree was a Montmorency and its early fruit looked as though it had been dipped in fresh blood. <br/><span></span>\
			Mrs. Pritchet approached the tree with her bouquet of daisies but Violet shied away from the fruit and danced back up the hill, spinning a pair of long wooden wands with brightly colored ribbons attached to the ends. Mrs. Pritchet sighed and bowed to place the flowers at the tree’s base. She held her hand to the trunk, trying to feel through to the life that lay there.<br/><span></span>\
			But to the left, in an adjoining row of trees, a movement caught her eye. <br/><span></span>\
\
			It looked more female to her this time, but that could have been simply because its hair had grown longer, a huge tangle of dull brown clotted with dirt and bits of leaves. It was about Violet’s height but its eyes were bright and sunken with hunger− it had probably lived on garbage through the winter and spring, or perhaps it had a store of rotted fruit. She could not tell what it was wearing, something stained to the same color as the dull path on which she now stood, though the front bore a series of red and purple streaks from the cherries it had collected.  <br/><span></span>\
			The demon could very well have already picked− could have eaten− pieces of her own dear William’s mother. She felt something in her soul darken.<br/><span></span>\
			“You cursed beast!” she shrieked. “Do not lay another tainted hand on these trees!”<br/><span></span>\
			It turned and looked at her, its bright eyes allert with fear. It began to back away limping, trying not to spill the cherries it had gathered in a small dirty square of folded cloth. <br/><span></span>\
			But Mrs. Pritchet was overcome with fury. This was her Downing, her orchard, and she should come to lay here too some distant day without fear of cannibalism!<br/><span></span>\
			“Get out!” she yelled.<br/><span></span>\
			She picked up a heavy stone and heaved it towards the beast. It missed its mark and rolled harmlessly towards a brass plaque at the base of one of the trees. The second one, however, struck the creature’s shoulder. With a sharp cry it fell backwards. Black and red cherries to roll outwards like a collapsing wave of blood. <br/><span></span>\
			It scrambled to its feet, still keening, and broke into a limping jog, fumbling at passing branches to support itself.<br/><span></span>\
			“Stay away you demon! Never come back to these trees!”<br/><span></span>\
			Mrs. Pritchet took a breath, ready to fling more threats more stones if necessary, but she turned at the sound of footsteps approaching. Jerry Glaser was running towards her up the path through the fading fog, his hunting revolver swinging from a strap slung over his back. <br/><span></span>\
			“Mrs. Pritchet,” he said panting. “I was out for a walk and heard you yelling. Are you all right? What is the matter?” He unslung his revolver as though he already knew quite well what the matter was.<br/><span></span>\
			“It was there!” she cried pointing. <br/><span></span>\
			He nodded without a word and took off in the direction she had indicated, revolver at the ready.<br/><span></span>\
			“Violet!” Mrs. Pritchet called, her voice tremulous from fear. The cherry trees wreathed in the remnants of fog no longer looked cheerful, and the flimsy bundle of daisies at her feet offered no comfort.<br/><span></span>\
			“Violet!” A small flock of finches rose out of a nearby tree, chirruping angrily. <br/><span></span>\
			She began to run in the direction that Jerry had disappeared after the demon, the same direction Violet had taken. She burst through the third row of cherries, skirt gathered into a tight bundle in her fist. On the dirt path ahead lay a wooden wand with colored ribbons trailing from its end like entrails. “Violet! Come here Violet!” She nearly screamed it. Why did no one answer?<br/><span></span>\
			In a panic, Mrs. Pritchet ran into the next row but her foot caught on the root of an old apple. With a cruel snap he ankle twisted, bringing her down to meet the damp morning earth.<br/><span></span>\
			“Violet!” she shrieked. She tried to stand but her vision starred with pain. She leaned against the trunk for support, desperately trying to listen over the thudding of her own heart.<br/><span></span>\
			“Mama!” <br/><span></span>\
			It was so faint she might have imagined it, somewhere off to the right but just then a crack rang out from the same direction, quickly followed by another. <br/><span></span>\
			 “Violet! Violet!” She limped painfully into the next row, fresh stars exploding in her eyes with every step, before she collapsed sobbing. No, it had to have been the creature. It could not possibly be her daughter. <br/><span></span>\
			But her unpardonable negligence had robbed her of the right to hope. She felt faint. She lay there for the duration of God’s eternity, her fist clenched around the wooden wand with the ribbons, pain shooting through her, until —<br/><span></span>\
			“Mrs. Pritchet,” came Jerry Glaser’s voice. <br/><span></span>\
			He sounded far off and under water. Circles of whiteness framed and danced around his hunched figure as he emerged through branches heavy with unripe plums.<br/><span></span>\
			Through the oncoming whiteness she could see that he bore a small dusty bundle over his shoulder. <br/><span></span>\
			Mrs. Pritchet blinked at it furiously, willing the light to resolve itself. <br/><span></span>\
			“Violet?” she asked weakly, as the world disappeared into white.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
			 “It was female,” Jerry Glaser said the next afternoon as he stood with her in the little stone kitchen. In the other room, Miss Eva was arranging a bundle of fresh flowers in a clay vase.<br/><span></span>\
			Mrs. Pritchet nodded once. Her ankle was bound into a thick brace and her heart fluttered at loud noises. She was happy they had come.<br/><span></span>\
			She caught leaves of rose tea in a metal strainer, breathing in the lovely heavy scent that lifted on the steam. She poured the tea into three porcelain cups, cups that had been left to her by Grandmother Pritchet. <br/><span></span>\
			There would be no tree planted this time.<br/><span></span>\
			She sipped at her tea and gazed through the north window at Violet playing with her wooden horses in the grass, making them gallop over tree roots and bundles of twigs. In the dappled sunlight, the child’s yellow hair glowed as though gilded. Her small face was fixed with concentration on her task, and every now and then a look of delight would flit across, lifting up the corners of the girl’s thin lips.\
			Mrs. Pritchet watched the light play off her daughter’s hair for a while before she remembered her guests and turned from the window. As she spread blackcurrant jam on pieces of rye bread for lunch, something in her heart rose on gold-tipped wings and exploded with love.",

	text: "Half of the river was missing, or so it looked to Tag as she stood by the stone wall, barefooted in her pajamas, digging the tips of her toes into the loamy soil. That afternoon Lilly had accidentally-on-purpose stepped on Tag’s already battered glasses and one of the plastic ovals snapped clean out. Even though Tag was a genius with superglue as well as packaging tape, band-aids, condiments, and thickened spit, the wire frame itself had bent into a Class F calamitous triangle and there was not much of a Gluing Platform to work with. So she stared through her remaining glass at the right half of the starlit river and wondered whether the witch would come again tonight.<br/><span><span>\
			It was just past one in the morning or so, but Tag had all night to wait. She listened to the croaking chorus of frogs, which did not appear to notice that a small human female had entered their midst. “Blork!” they sang with gusto. “Blork blork blork.” <br/><span><span>\
			A new frog had just come in from New York City− he had hopped and swam for two years and seven months straight to get down the Mississippi to Louisiana and had absolutely fabulous quadriceps, ladies. He was telling the others about the double twirled mustaches on taxi drivers and the skyscrapers made of diamonds and emeralds and the famous people and the Mona Lisa. He had lived in a top-notch drainpipe in upper East Manhattan with all of the frog celebrities, and the other frogs wanted to know which frog celebrities in particular? All of them, he blorked back.  <br/><span><span>\
			Tag blorked once too, just to let them know that she was going to be a celebrity one day and go to New York and to Siberia and to Tai Wan and be a superheroine also, but it must have come off as toadish, because the frogs ignored her. <br/><span><span>\
			She scanned the river once more with her glass but the witch still wasn’t there; maybe she wouldn’t come tonight. <br/><span><span>\
			In the meantime Tag decided to look for something dead to put in Lilly’s bed. A rodent would be best though she might have to settle for a fish or even one of the frogs. <br/><span><span>\
			The combination of one glass and no moon made visibility less than ideal. But it was a million times better than the painfully insistent light of day, against which she had no pigment to protect her. The sun was her kryptonite. In the night she was powerful.<br/><span><span>\
			With a special left-right twist that she was still perfecting, Tag became a hound with black and brown fur and cute ears. Actually brown and white fur with cute ears. <br/><span><span>\
			“Woof,” she said once, for practice.<br/><span><span>\
			“Blork,” a frog replied from a bush to her left.<br/><span><span>\
			She sniffed up and down the base of the wall that ran along the river for a dead animal, but there was no indicative smell of putrid meat. The wall simply smelled like dirt, with an after-scent of moss. She next sniffed at the trumpet-flower bushes that grew along the shallows of the river where the frogs lived but those smelled like Fruit Loops— delicious. She grew a butterfly tongue and extended it to the polleny tip of a trumpet flower, but her butterfly taste buds failed to deploy resulting in necessary projectile saliva. <br/><span><span>\
			As she was bending down to sniff at a promising patch of dirt, Tag heard a faint swishing noise of something shuffling through long grass. It grew steadily louder as it came. Approach speed of seven point nine miles per hour, her supersonic inner calibration systems told her, and an approach direction of eighty degrees southwest of the wall. Or perhaps northeast. She switched on her invisibility, and dropped into a black eagle crouch behind one of the trumpet flower bushes.<br/><span><span>\
			Between the dark leaves she spied the witch, lumbering closer along the wall. A colossal witch she was too, with thighs that rolled like barrels under a dirty white dress and breasts that looked the ones the other girls at the Hill Home made by stuffing pillows in their shirts. Her dark face shone with sweat in the light of a lantern she carried. <br/><span><span>\
			Like last night, the witch placed her tattered sack of enchantments with care onto the grass next the wall. With a magnificent grunt, she lowered herself after the sack and upended it, spilling out a pile of things that clanked as they went. She started sorting through her equipment, little sparks dancing off pieces of metal and wood that only Tag could see. A low creepish hum came from her throat that sounded like it should be accompanied by a cello. It was probably her anthem that all witches had.<br/><span><span>\
			Tag could tell that the witch’s fingers were moving rapidly as she cast her first spell but the bush, while adequate cover for already invisible superheroines, did not allow for close-up masterful spying. Especially when said superheroine possessed only one glass out of a more archetypal two. <br/><span><span>\
			Last night had been necessary reconnaissance. The witch had placed stones into mysterious piles in grass, placed stone in mysterious piles on wall, and uttered many bizarro words. Tonight, Tag needed more information and she was going to get it. Despite her weird words and hand sparks, the witch looked a like a slow mover. Tag would risk a confrontation, perhaps one leading to a duel to the death (the witch’s death) ridding northeastern Louisiana of a treacherous sorceress. Her first arch nemesis. Or: befriend the witch, become her superhuman prodigy and escape the Hill Home with her to Nepal, where a snow leopard could be located for taming. Outcome dependent on witch’s reaction. Tag decided on a diagonal, approach, maintaining invisibility until no longer able. <br/><span><span>\
			The river’s gurgles hid the sounds of her approach, or perhaps the witch was too engrossed in her spell to notice. Tag drew closer from the back, a left hook preparing itself inside the muscles of her upper arm. All good superheroines were born with an instinct for karate.<br/><span><span>\
			Up closer, the witch’s hair looked like shiny black worms that ended with slightly yellowed white beads. The beads clacked like bones when she moved her head.<br/><span><span>\
			Once Tag got to within four feet, she deactivated her invisibility with a small, almost impossible to hear beep.  <br/><span><span>\
			The witch, who should have been able to see her now, showed no sign. She was placing small rounded pebbles into a series of circles and humming like her life depended on it. Bundles of string knotted mysteriously sat off to her left, illuminated by the lantern.<br/><span><span>\
			Tag was definitely in sight now, but there was no reaction other than humming. It was time to make the first move.<br/><span><span>\
			“Hi,” she said. She squatted down in the grass a couple of feet away from the witch.<br/><span><span>\
			Humming continued.<br/><span><span>\
			“Hi, I’m Tag.” There was no indication the witch saw or heard, except for maybe a slight increase in the intensity of her humming.<br/><span><span>\
			Perhaps further explanation was required. “I’m from the Hill Home,” Tag said, “but I’m not like the others.” Everyone in school knew not to talk to the Hill girls, but the witch looked as if she had been nowhere near a school in a while so maybe she didn’t know. “No pigment,” she said holding up her arm. “But that’s okay, it’s not fatal.” <br/><span><span>\
				Tag pointed at the beads. “Are those the teeth of your enemies?” she asked. “I would definitely wear Lilly’s teeth in my hair.” <br/><span><span>\
				When all of that received no response, she followed it with: “What are you doing anyways? With the stones and things?” She was going to ask about a spell but she realized the woman might not want Tag to know that she was a witch. That was usually only for the initiated. Which meant Tag needed to be initiated. <br/><span><span>\
			But until then there were other matters of business at hand<br/><span><span>\
				“Have you seen any dead animals nearby?”<br/><span><span>\
			The witch’s mouth moved but no words came out, only hums. She lifted herself off the ground and flopped down a bit further away from Tag, leaving a largish witch-sized crater in the grass. She began to construct another circle of pebbles, all the while humming her anthem. A confrontation was appearing less likely so Tag moved forward with her second, preferred plan.<br/><span><span>\
				 “I can help,” said Tag importantly. “I may look different but that’s just shows I’m special.”<br/><span><span>\
				No reaction. She would offer up her many talents.<br/><span><span>\
				“I’m a good learner, if you teach me. Not so much in school, but I taught myself how to do karate, and I’m learning how to summon cats.”<br/><span><span>\
				To show her karate, Tag did a couple of kicks followed by punches and ducking-downs to avoid punches. She did her newest spin-kick-with-hiya! but her left foot collided with the wall before she could turn on her ability to pass through solid surfaces, resulting in rather unheroic pain. A stone the size of an apple fell from the wall with a dull thunk. <br/><span><span>\
				The woman broke her anthem with a sharp yell, and Tag jumped in surprise. That also hurt and Tag made a note on her internal computer not to jump right after colliding with a wall. The witch’s eyes were bugging practically out of her skull and her mouth was working to form words. She gestured urgently towards the wall.<br/><span><span>\
				“They is — people — in there!” She sounded like she was chewing on the words, swallowing them partway and then regurgitating as much as she could. <br/><span><span>\
				“People?” Tag asked. She gave the wall a closer look. <br/><span><span>\
				“This for them,” the witch said, indicating her rocks and knots. “They needs me.” She put a hand to her enormous chest for emphasis. Something was wrong with her words.<br/><span><span>\
				Tag looked more carefully at the wall to see if she was missing something. Perhaps heads would pop out from behind and welcome her to their order.<br/><span><span>\
				“They is — moon people,” said the witch with slow determination. “This is moon wall.”<br/><span><span>\
				“A what?”<br/><span><span>\
				“Who,” she replied. “They is who.” The witch shook her head and chuckled a slow deep chuckle. “Listen. You hear them”<br/><span><span>\
				Tag listened. She had very good hearing; in fact she was a genius at everything except seeing and that only on account of laser vision interference with normal vision. One day she would be beautiful as well, and people would admire her everywhere and stop being afraid of her whiteness and her eye. <br/><span><span>\
				At first she couldn’t hear anything except frogs and river water, but as she listened harder, faint voices rose above the sloshes of the river: from somewhere inside the stones she could hear polite conversations about the changing seasons, small shouts as one moon person told another to keep his trash out of her yard, moon dogs barking, and giggles as moon parents told the moon children bedtime stories. There was an entire city in there, in that wall. She could almost see them too, living in their tininess, not aware of the superheroine and the witch right outside.<br/><span><span>\
				“Why is it a moon wall?” Tag asked after a while. <br/><span><span>\
				The witch did not answer. She had gone back to placing more knots in her twine and had started her humming again. <br/><span><span>\
			Tag sat down and watched. “Have you ever been to Nepal?” she asked after a minute. “I’m going to find a snow leopard there and name her Snow. You could come with us if you like.”<br/><span><span>\
				But the witch was fully engrossed in her task for the moon people. Perhaps she was building them houses that started with stone and ended with magic. Tag listened for a while longer, as the moon people celebrated somebody’s birthday. Another moon family got a moon parrot, which squawked when they talked to it. <br/><span><span>\
			But she had stayed for a long time and she still needed to find something dead. Time for a retreat until tomorrow, everyone. Goodbye frogs! she called in frequencies only frogs could hear. Goodbye witch! she said in witch frequencies. <br/><span><span>\
				The witch apparently noticed, especially when Tag started walking towards the part of the wall where the dirt road that took her back to the Hill House began.<br/><span><span>\
				“Tag!” she said, heaving herself up off the grass. “Tag,” she said again, pointing at her, and Tag stopped, waiting for the witch to say something. <br/><span><span>\
			When she didn’t, Tag asked “Well what?” <br/><span><span>\
			Was this it? Was this her initiation? Perhaps the witch had been testing her with spells all night and she had passed. They would learn how to fly and she could leave the Hill Home and all of the girls and Mrs. Q and never see them again, ever.<br/><span><span>\
				But the witch gestured towards her own chest instead. “Tu-la,” she said carefully, pronouncing each syllable independently.<br/><span><span>\
				“Tula?”<br/><span><span>\
				The witch nodded, a broad smile revealing uneven teeth.<br/><span><span>\
				Just a name, no induction into a secret order where Tag would learn magic and meet other witches. She tried not to feel the crush of disappointment as she stepped onto the dirt road; there was always tomorrow to impress the witch. <br/><span><span>\
			Close to the home, she found a piece of road-kill that she hadn’t noticed on the way over. She couldn’t tell what it used to be but it had fur and smelled awful so she carefully peeled it up and held it between two broad magnolia leaves. <br/><span><span>\
			\
				Tag snuck in through the window to the locked room at the back of the home using her instinctively exceptional climbing skills. Once in, she was a master spy with intelligence that told her about the grating that opened into the bathroom cabinet. The first time she had snuck out of the Hill Home, just a week ago, she had been terrified that she wouldn’t be able to get back in; that the window would lock or the grating wouldn’t move. Mrs. Q. would have found her out on the porch the next morning and Tag would be punished with a capital P. But she had gotten back and each time it worked she had grown more confident. She could finally be free outside without getting teased or burned. <br/><span><span>\
				Then last night she had made it all the way to the river and had seen the witch, and tonight she had met her.<br/><span><span>\
				On silent, she crept into the bedroom she shared with seven of the others including snot-faced Lilly. Even asleep they looked evil, their lips curled into little snarls, their sheets tangled into ropes. Girls came and left either if they were lucky and found real foster homes, or when they turned 12 and were sent to Twin Oaks. <br/><span><span>\
			When she first came they used to punch her and pull her hair and make fun of her whiteness and her eye. They said she was the ugliest thing they ever saw with the ugliest name too. It was Lilly who decided to take the “t” out of Agatha and rearrange it to the front. From then on she was Tag, and she was always It.<br/><span><span>\
			But Tag was cleverer than they were and employed poison ivy, super glue, and live insects, which got her left alone in less than a month. But occasional reminders were necessary. <br/><span><span>\
				She stopped by Lilly’s bed and uncovered the road kill. She decided to wrap it into a pair of dingy underwear and bury it in Lilly’s clothing chest. To place it next to her head would have been too obvious.<br/><br/><span><span>\
			\
				Summer days at the Hill Home were uneventful and involved Tag trying to find a place out of the sun where she could practice her karate or laser eyesight. <br/><span><span>\
				She couldn’t visit the library over the summer because Mrs. Q practically never let them leave— it gave her a heart attack to not know where they were. She missed Mr. Pequot, the librarian, because he would talk to her and answer all of her questions and didn’t care that she looked different. Mr. Pequot was really old and his dark skin had absolutely no hair on it whatsoever. He had probably been a submarine driver and a surgeon and an astronaut at some point. He bore the look of outer space.<br/><span><span>\
				“Are you the oldest man living?” she had asked him one day.<br/><span><span>\
				He looked at her directly in her good eye and shook his head with infinite slowness.<br/><span><span>\
				“Not the oldest, no,” he said in his deep crumbly voice. “But I definitely come in second.”<br/><span><span>\
				“Oh.” That must put him at approximately 107, which was almost too old to be legal. But Tag was glad it was legal because she had a question about the book she was reading. <br/><span><span>\
			“Snow leopards are endangered species,” she said.<br/><span><span>\
				“Yep,” he said. “Only a few left in parts of northern Asia and the Himalayas.”<br/><span><span>\
				“I’m an endangered species too then,” she said.<br/><span><span>\
				He gazed at her as though observing her from a telescope on Neptune. “Albino is not a species, Agatha.”<br/><span><span>\
				“Why not?” <br/><span><span>\
				“Human is our species, Homo sapiens. You’re a part of that just like everybody else.”<br/><span><span>\
				Tag wondered how he was so sure. She thought for a moment. “Do you ever wish he would die?” she asked.<br/><span><span>\
				“Who?”<br/><span><span>\
				“The first oldest man. If he died, you would win.”<br/><span><span>\
				He shook his head and picked up a book. “Girl, you say the strangest things.”<br/><br/><span><span>\
				\
			Over the summer, the girls sometimes went on field trips but mostly they were supposed to stay in the yard and be model citizens. Tag wasn’t a model of anything, and it was the citizens she was protecting, so she mostly napped along the shady side of the fence, preserving her strength and trying not to get burned or teased by the other girls.<br/><span><span>\
			But Tag went back the next night to the moon wall and the one after that too. Tula said very little to her so she mostly practiced things like laser vision and the summoning of cats, and listened to the stories of the moon people, trapped in their wall. They had presidents and nations and pets and schools and lunchboxes and everything like there was in her world. Lots of moon children had parents but some didn’t and she told those ones that they could be superheroines too if they were nice and not like Lilly and the others.<br/><br/><span><span>\
			\
			Four days after her first visit, Tula showed her why the wall was a moon wall. It had been cloudy for the last several nights and hard to see anything in the sky. But that night it was clear, and on her walk over, Tag looked in pleasure at the lovely silver disk with its craters that were made from rocks and not from cheese. The sun hurt her, but the moon never hurt anyone and just moved oceans around.<br/><span><span>\
			Tag had been talking to the frogs by the hibiscus bushes when Tula suddenly broke her anthem and said “Tag!” and again, “Tag!”<br/><span><span>\
			Turning around, Tag saw. The moon wall looked like someone had pasted silver Christmas glitter all over it while her back was turned. Little shards of moonlight reflected off the stones every which way and made Tula’s silhouette look like a constellation.<br/><span><span>\
			“Moon people,” said Tula with conviction. “Moon tells them of seasons. Passing time.”<br/><span><span>\
			Tag walked up to the wall and gently laid a hand on it. Her hand didn’t sparkle but its whiteness blended in, as though they were both made of the same thing. <br/><span><span>\
			Some of the moon people knew who she was now, and to them maybe she was a superheroine already. But there were millions of moon people out there. An entire universe even. It was beautiful in the way that she would someday be beautiful. <br/><span><span>\
			\
				For a couple of weeks after the moon wall first glowed, Tag went there almost every night it wasn’t raining. She napped more than ever during the days. This made them go faster and reserved her strength so the sun couldn’t deplete it.<br/><span><span>\
			But on a Wednesday afternoon after a night spent conversing with the moon people about the moon queen’s upcoming birthday, Mrs. Q poked her awake and told her people would be there to see her that afternoon. <br/><span><span>\
			It had never happened to her but course she knew what that meant. She was so excited she could hardly sit through lunch. She decided to wear a Power Puff Girls t-shirt that had come through in the last clothing drop, with a pair of lime green shorts.<br/><span><span>\
			When Tag went out on the porch at two-o’clock sharp, there was a couple waiting, the woman wearing a yellow dress and a smile, and the man wearing a plum-colored suit that was intimidating, because nobody wore suits. She was glad that there was no sun on that side of the house to burn her. <br/><span><span>\
			“Hello Agatha,” said the lady when Tag closed the front door behind her, her voice sounding like the voice of a princess angel who knew how to speak French, cook, and save lives. Her lipstick was the pink of a bunny rabbit’s nose. Her hair was a gorgeous brunette and her eyes were as dark as well-toasted toast. She looked like the mother of a superheroine.  <br/><span><span>\
			Tag gave her a return smile but a small correction was in order, “My name is not Agatha because that’s ugly, it’s Tag. You’re really beautiful, is that your own hair?”<br/><span><span>\
			 The husband’s eyebrows rose. Mrs. Q who was standing behind the couple gave Tag a frown and a tiny shake of her head but didn’t say anything. She gave Tag a small warning look and then went off the porch and around the side, presumably to check on the other girls<br/><span><span>\
			 “Oh, okay…Tag,” said the woman, her smile wavering into two slightly straighter pink lines.  <br/><span><span>\
			“I’m It!” Tag said and skipped up to them grinning, her hand held out as though about to tag them. She grinned and looked into the lovely lady’s eyes, but as the lady looked back, her smile faded further. She twisted a small strand of dark brown hair around her finger.<br/><span><span>\
			Tag leaned in. “Do you want to know my middle name?” she whispered, so that only the lady could hear. She didn’t have a middle name but maybe the lady didn’t know this and would think it actually was Emma, which was a very pretty name. Eventually she the lady might call her by this instead of Tag or Agatha.<br/><span><span>\
			But instead of answering her, the lady turned to look at something behind her own right shoulder, in the usual spot where nothing ever was. <br/><span><span>\
			“There’s never things there,” said Tag. “Don’t worry.”<br/><span><span>\
			But the lady frowned and whispered something into her husband’s ear. Both looked down at her.<br/><span><span>\
			“Agatha, is there something wrong with your eye? The left one, does it hurt?” <br/><span><span>\
			Tag shook her head quickly as though dislodging a bug. “That’s my laser eye. It wanders to keeps people safe from my laser vision, in case it turns on at the wrong moment.”<br/><span><span>\
			“I see.” The lady said something else into her husband’s ear and then turned to talk quietly to Mrs. Q, who had just returned. <br/><span><span>\
			“We knew about the albinism from the picture, but the eye…”<br/><span><span>\
			The husband’s plum colored suit had grown dark sweat spots under the arms, reducing his intimidation factor tenfold. He shifted his weight from one leg the other.<br/><span><span>\
			“Have you ever been to Nepal?” Tag asked him.<br/><span><span>\
			 “Um, no I can’t say I have,” he replied.<br/><span><span>\
			“What about New York City?”<br/><span><span>\
				“Been there.” He nodded distractedly and looked at his wife.<br/><span><span>\
			“Where did you live?”<br/><span><span>\
				He seemed surprised that she was still talking. “I suppose we stayed in a hotel. The Hilton.”<br/><span><span>\
			“How many famous people have you seen?”<br/><span><span>\
			“Well—”<br/><span><span>\
			His response was interrupted by the lady who was finished talking to a distressed-looking Mrs. Q. “I’m sorry Tag, but we have to go now,” said the lady.<br/><span><span>\
			She was smiling again but it wasn’t as nice. It couldn’t save as many lives. <br/><span><span>\
			Tag stayed on the porch while Mrs. Q walked with them to their car. The laser eye couldn’t be that scary; it was a force of good after all. What if she had worn the yellow shirt she found instead, or the jeans? Maybe the lady didn’t approve of cartoons or of Hello Kitty in particular. The car was already out of the driveway when Tag realized that she had forgotten to tell the lady about Snow and Nepal.<br/><br/><span><span>\
			\
			After they left Mrs. Q denied her request to stay inside (Mrs. Q did not believe in spoiling, no siree!). She would have to go join the others in the noxious sunshine.<br/><span><span>\
			Lilly was putting on a play about a kingdom in the dusty yard. Her stupid face was the queen and stupid June was her king and some of the other girls were farmers and servants. Ava lurked off to the side where she traced vulgar words in the dirt with a scowl. Sam had taken her shirt off and was twisting it into ropes with a vacant grin on her face, chuckling like it was the most amusing thing ever. Her pale exposed stomach streaked with dirt that the others had thrown made Tag feel even worse. <br/><span><span>\
			In fact, Sam reminded her a bit of Tula, though Sam didn’t know any magic and none of them knew about the moon wall. <br/><span><span>\
			“Agatha!” Lilly shrieked when June pointed her out. She was clearly delighted that Tag had failed to be wanted. “That poor couple is going to have nightmares of your face tonight!” The other girls giggled obediently. <br/><span><span>\
			Tag tried to ignore them, though she collected a pocketful of sand to put into their dinner later. When she turned eighteen, she would find her snow leopard and Tula would teach them magic and they would only come out at night to duel with villains and ladies who shouldn’t be mothers. Snow and Snow White. So famous that Lilly and June and all of the others would cry out of jealousy. <br/><span><span>\
			Tag sat there by the fence for the length of several eternities, feeling the sun burn her skin and watching Sam chew on her t-shirt. She couldn’t stop thinking about the girl the lady would choose instead. That girl probably had beautiful raven black hair with emerald green eyes and no glasses. As the sun grew lower and Mrs. Q finally called them in for dinner, one tear dripped out of the side of Tag’s normal eye. It was followed by another, and then several more, and this time it was really hard to pretend that they were made of diamonds.<br/><br/><span><span>\
		\
			It was cloudy that night at the moon wall, so the stones did not glitter and the moon people would have to guess at whether the seasons were passing or not. Tula, with all her magic, must have known about the evil foster parents because she brought along two glazed donuts in a greasy brown napkin, which she presented to Tag before lowering her bag to the ground. Her round face bore a proud, self-important look, as though she had tracked and hunted the donuts down with a bow and arrow.<br/><span><span>\
			The donuts themselves appeared to have been crushed between heavy books, and one had a small crescent nibble taken out of it, but it had been centuries since Tag had eaten anything sweeter than breakfast cereal. She tore at the first with two bites of her leopard fangs. The moon wall sparkled dimly as the moon appeared from behind a cloud.<br/><span><span>\
			Tag licked the sweet stickiness off her fingers but the look on Tula’s face was so hopeful that Tag gave her the second, already-nibbled-in donut. It was the superheroine thing to do.<br/><span><span>\
			Her skin hurt from her sunburn so while Tula hummed her anthem and built piles of stones on and around the wall, Tag took off her clothes and splashed into the river. She didn’t know how to swim but she waded in waist deep and stood there, feeling the water part around her, as the frogs blorked stories of her greatness.<br/><span><span>\

	text: "A drop of water that reeked of lavender shampoo fell from the hair of Dr. Frances Roche onto her paper, extinguishing the sharp Greek characters of her vector sum. Frances cursed and tilted her chair to a seven degree angle as she shook her head, scattering equally pungent drops throughout the tiny windowless shed. She abhorred all activities that wasted time, a list that included but was not limited to waiting for tables at restaurants, conversing with strangers, petting domesticated animals, anything to do with undergraduate students, and taking showers. <br/><span></span>\
				Yet at her sister Libby’s insistence, Frances had just taken her first shower in twenty-nine and a half days that included shampoo. This particular shower set Frances’s computations back by twenty-seven minutes<br/><span></span>\
					“Twenty-six,” one corrected. <br/><span></span>\
					“Negate the gamma in line two,” said another one.<br/><span></span>\
					Frances nodded, and took up the pen again. She had scheduled a precious hour tomorrow to use the new digital computer in the MIT theoretical physics department. She needed to calculate this set of inputs for her galactic expansion simulations, or Moby Greenshaw with the receding hairline would gleefully cut off her future usage. <br/><span></span>\
				The desk at which she sat was in fact crammed into a converted tool shed that stood against the fence that separated the sprawling lawn of her parents’ house in the suburbs from the Petrarchs’ next door, a shed that in grade school had provided a haven from their worry, and later their disapproval. These days Frances only left Boston for her parents’ house when her presence was mandated, but in that time neither the shed nor their disapproval had changed.	<br/><span></span>\
				Every available surface was covered by stacks of papers, except for a chemical cabinet and work table that was instead strewn with sealed jars and periodic burns from high school experiments. Equations handwritten in black ink crept across all the papers like colonies of ants. Sometimes Frances gave a half-hearted attempt to organize it all, to separate the fluid dynamics from the plasma physics but there was no use. Entropy would win. <br/><span></span>\
				Even the walls were plastered with paper, yellowed newspaper clippings and journal articles, some of them circled, highlighted and written over; like a serial killer with a thing for physicists, Libby had said to Aunt Jeanette last Thanksgiving.<br/><span></span>\
				The most lovingly annotated Times article hung in a spot of honor above the desk was from 1964 when Frances had been in the fourth grade and described Dr. Vera Ruben’s theory of the existence of dark matter. A faded poster of the Horsehead Nebula that hung above the articles gave the only hint of color in the room, and a single bare light bulb crusted with the dehydrated shell of an electrocuted mosquito provided a hesitant source of light. <br/><span></span>\
					A knock sounded on the door. Frances muttered without looking up from her paper. It was followed by a louder knock, and when Frances again ignored it, the door opened and the pretty face of a young woman poked through, allowing in the scent of the freshly mowed lawn.<br/><span></span>\
					“Oh goodness, you’re naked,” Libby said. <br/><span></span>\
					“I took a shower,” Frances said curtly.<br/><span></span>\
					“Most people get dressed after showers.”  <br/><span></span>\
					Frances said nothing but scratched furiously at an incorrect inequality. <br/><span></span>\
					“And holy Jesus,” said Libby leaning closer. “What happened to your hair this time? It’s all shortened and burnt on the left side!”<br/><span></span>\
					It had been magnesium. <br/><span></span>\
					“Negative sign,” one said. <br/><span></span>\
				Frances added it in, and carried it through all the steps in which it had previously been left out. Two of the terms now canceled. <br/><span></span>\
					“You need to try tonight,” said Libby, her tone pleading.<br/><span></span>\
					“Quiet,” one said.<br/><span></span>\
				“Look, I brought makeup, and if you want, I’ll help you with it.” She held up a zippered bag that clattered threateningly. “But you have to get dressed.”<br/><span></span>\
					“Quiet quiet quiet!” one was saying over and over.<br/><span></span>\
				Frances couldn’t lose focus or Moby Greenshaw would win. She finished one set of Christoffels and began again with the next metric tensor in the model. <br/><span></span>\
				Later, Libby. Later she would try.<br/><span></span>\
				“Yes, yes, yes good splendid,” they called as she went. She glanced up as she started a new sheet of paper. <br/><span></span>\
				Libby stood there her lip trembling slightly. A single tendril of a soft brown curl that was stuck to the lip trembled as well as it was driven anharmonically. <br/><span></span>\
				“You know I’ve warned Gregory about you,” she said. “You’re 27 years old and all you do is sit around mumbling nonsense and being rude.”<br/><span></span>\
				“Mumbling,” one said. “Mumbling mumbling mumbling.”<br/><span></span>\
				“Summing over those indices so switch the beta to rho.”<br/><span></span>\
				“Almost there,” said a third.<br/><span></span>\
				Frances wrote rapidly, willing the voices to be quiet. She really wanted to care. Libby had always been tuned to a different frequency but that the fault of genetics, not Libby. <br/><span></span>\
				When she finally reached the end of the line, she put the pen down. “What’s for dinner?” she asked. That was appropriate. Evidence of interest.<br/><span></span>\
				But Libby’s grey eyes narrowed. <br/><span></span>\
				“Don’t do that!” she cried. “And wear something nice. This is important.”<br/><span></span>\
				Frances was confused. “Do what? Is it lentils?” She liked to organize lentils by diameter and coloration but to do it properly required a set of lenses.<br/><span></span>\
				“And don’t say strange things, and no demonstrations. Remember the wedding last April−”<br/><span></span>\
				“Or maybe salmon,” one said in her ear. Its skin had birefringent properties. <br/><span></span>\
				“And put on makeup.” Libby brandished the bag again and her voice rose in frequency like an approaching train, blue shifted.<br/><span></span>\
					Frances regarded her curiously. Libby’s curls bent at irregular intervals where they had been taken up and down then twisted in a bun and then taken down again. A chipped nail had recently been repainted− Frances could smell the offensive nitrocellulose. And from the streaks in the density of her face powder, Libby had clearly cried through one layer of makeup already. <br/><span></span>\
					Frances tried to nod but her gaze was caught by the next set of coefficients. <br/><span></span>\
					She would try.<br/><span></span>\
					With a high pitched cry akin to the whine of the liquid nitrogen nozzle, Libby spun and rushed out the door. The grass scent from the yard wafted in again. <br/><span></span>\
					“Don’t ruin it, Frances!” her retreating voice sobbed. “I really like him.”<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
					Of course Frances knew men: all the post-docs in the MIT department of theoretical physics were male, except for one flat-chested, hollow-eyed female from the Soviet Union who spoke next to no English when she spoke at all. <br/><span></span>\
				The men were an irregular set, and tolerated one another in the way that fiercely territorial male lions understand that they are all capable of carnage but choose to abstain in favor of staying alive. Every success on a neighboring chalkboard equated to a failure on one’s own. Each congratulatory exclamation over a colleague’s newly published paper carried with it an unspoken oath of vengeance. They did not swap boastful stories of undergrad revelries, they did not share potato chips or salt shakers in the commons, and they did not go to bars and form teams to play trivia against the chemists. <br/><span></span>\
				For the most part, Frances ignored them quite successfully, and they back. <br/><span></span>\
				The one exception was Jim Salman. He was 28 and almost as ugly as she was plain, with watery eyes and a face that might have been run over by a lawn mower when he was a child. Frances was not sure what it was, and did not care to define such things, but Jim had somehow resisted her best attempts to ignore him.<br/><span></span>\
				It had started on the twenty-fifth of December of her first year. Newtonmas, the lions called it. It had been six in the evening and from what she could see, hers was the only light on in the building. She had been working on a proof, the proof, and it had not been proceeding according to plan. <br/><span></span>\
				Reparameterize, they had called all afternoon into the spaces of her head, but every time it led to dead end. Swap out variables and multiply by the Anderson-Figaré matrix and its inverse: redundancy. Rewrite the second integral and solve: more redundancy. <br/><span></span>\
					Eventually she had left for food.<br/><span></span>\
					Jim it turned out, had spent the day in the pitch dark of the optics lab realigning Fabry Perot interferometers for one of the undergraduate courses, and had just stepped out into the frigid December air to light a cigarette. <br/><span></span>\
				Smoking was an extraordinary waste of time crossed with an unpleasant odor; Frances had been less than impressed. Yet when she had passed him, Jim’s head bobbed uncomfortably to the left, as though he had tried to nod but the mass was not centered well enough.<br/><span></span>\
					She retorted with what she hoped was a disinterested grunt, and wrapped her scarf up over her face like a burqa against the cold. <br/><span></span>\
				She had already walked several steps past the entrance when he suddenly said, “Arc to Arcturus!” <br/><span></span>\
				She turned and saw that he was pointing eagerly to a hazy bright dot on the western horizon. When he noticed he had her attention he eagerly swept his hand from the base of the Ursa Major down its long starry handle to land back at Arcturus. <br/><span></span>\
				She rolled her eyes, painful in the cold. “I’m an astrophysicist, I don’t need the dipper to find Arcturus.” <br/><span></span>\
				His hand flopped down to his side, and his eager face fell with it. Her stomach growled demandingly yet something governed by more complicated equations kept her rooted there.<br/><span></span>\
				It was freezing. Neither of them moved.<br/><span></span>\
				Voices rose and chattered in her ears but she was unable to make out what they were saying. After seven seconds of uncomfortable silence, she cleared her throat and Jim looked up so hopefully that Frances felt an odd constriction in her chest. <br/><span></span>\
				 “Speed on to Spica,” she finally suggested in a monotone. It was the next star in the line after Arcturus. <br/><span></span>\
				“Speed on to Spica!” he agreed. His eyes watered in awe as though she had invented the mnemonic device herself, or perhaps discovered the star.<br/><span></span>\
				Having exhausted the range of her expressive capabilities, Frances had tramped off across the frozen ground to order Chinese from Panda Nation. She had not pointed out that Spica set hours ago.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				Frances decided on the green dress. She kept it crumpled up in the top corner of the broken file cabinet with her Year Three papers on condensed matter physics because it was the only piece of clothing she had ever liked. It was streaked with a linear stain above the right breast from an unfortunate fracture involving calcium permanganate, but it appeared that no one had ever noticed it. Or never noticed her right breast. <br/><span></span>\
				And green was Libby’s favorite color.<br/><span></span>\
					She smoothed and parallelized her hair with her left hand as she tackled the next set of coefficients with the right. Some of the crisper burnt ends crumbled away; all of the oils that had barely been sustaining them had been wicked off by the glycerides in the shower soaps. <br/><span></span>\
					“That third tensor is symmetric so you can flip the gamma and rho and simplify,” one said.<br/><span></span>\
					“Fourth too,” added another. <br/><span></span>\
				The only thing that remained was the makeup. Waste of time and minerals but Libby said this was important. <br/><span></span>\
				“−conservation of the rest energy in the frame invariant product enables the retention of those terms,” the same one was saying. Frances hadn’t caught the first bit but that seemed like it was going somewhere. She wrote it down in the margin of an unopened envelope with a government address, likely another warning against the unauthorized use of something she had purchased.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				On the seventeenth of January, Jim had waited and held the door to the copying room open for her even though she only was halfway down the hall when he entered. She copied the papers for a presentation she was delivering later that day on dark matter distributions, fully aware that he was staring at her the entire time.<br/><span></span>\
				Thankfully he wasn’t staring at her all afternoon however, because one of them convinced her to acquire a sample of thorium powder that had just been shipped in for a lab in the experimental building. <br/><span></span>\
				“Yes, yes,” they said over and over. “How very interesting.”<br/><br/><span></span>\
					<br/><span></span>\
				The makeup tubes that Libby left behind came without instruction. Frances held one up to the light between her thumb and forefinger as though examining a newly discovered crystal for its refractive properties. <br/><span></span>\
				There was a secretary named Barbette in the physics department office who answered phones and opened grant letters, and she had an uncommonly memorable face on account of the makeup she wore like a mask. Frances would try for that. <br/><span></span>\
				She faced the partially reflecting metal file cabinet after removing a journal article taped over half of it and started with smallest tube, which read Bare Grace.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				 On the twentieth of February, Jim had switched his hours on the two-photon ablating microscope so that she could make it to a presentation on the energy density of the vacuum by a visiting Cambridge professor. His ugly face lit up when he told her this and it made her happier than it should have.<br/><span></span>\
				In a miracle of statistics, they had run into each other later that same day at Taco Villa and he had finished her cardboard boat of tortilla chips for her. To fill the silence of the near-vacuum between them, she described her equations, about the unseen energy that held their universe together, that kept the stars and dust spinning in their cosmic spirals. About how it looked so empty but acted so full.<br/><span></span>\
				It was not the last cardboard boat of tortilla chips she shared, and each time they arrived at the grease-stained bottom, she had given away another fragment of herself, and received an unfamiliar fragment in return.<br/><br/><span></span>\
					<br/><span></span>\
				Makeup applied and dress straightened, Frances exited the shed, and locked the door with a combination lock, thumbprint deadbolt, and a heavy key she wore on a leather cord around her neck.  Her head tilted instinctually upwards, over the aspen trees that grew along the fence line where her parents’ yard bordered the Petrarchs’ next door. <br/><span></span>\
				There was Arcturus, rising now above the eastern horizon. Brightest in Bootes, tip of the staff of the shepherd, a twisted hexagon of suns arbitrarily chosen by ancient Greeks but useful today nevertheless. Dark energy between here and there unquantified but not unquantifiable. <br/><span></span>\
				The faint ribbon of galaxy was setting in the west, melting seamlessly into the sickly haze of light pollution from distant Boston. Why could she not stay out here and watch it complete its descent? <br/><span></span>\
				“Stay then,” one said. <br/><span></span>\
				“Venus is setting,” mentioned a second.<br/><span></span>\
					But at the same time she was uncharacteristically excited to see Libby, to show her that she could pull it off when it came down to it. <br/><span></span>\
				And Mother too. When Frances was little, Mother had tried so hard to help her dress nicely, to answer questions the right way, and to look at people in the eye when they talked to her. When that didn’t work she had sought help. But Frances never failed to mildly baffle any professional her mother infinitebooked for an appointment.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
				She encountered Libby in the foyer where she had been pacing nervously by the door. Frances gave a shy grin, anticipating the praise. <br/><span></span>\
				But Libby’s face contracted with horror. “What on earth are you wearing? And your face, you look like a clown!”<br/><span></span>\
					Frances stared blankly at her. <br/><span></span>\
					“Forty minutes gone,” one said. It sounded rather sad.<br/><span></span>\
					“Just this once, I thought you could be normal,” Libby sniveled, her voice breaking on the ‘you’.<br/><span></span>\
					Father appeared at the foot of the stairs, his dinner suit and stern expression offset by his bald forehead, which shone cheerfully in the well-lit hall like a polished rock. <br/><span></span>\
					“Now Frances,” he said, his voice curt. “Your sister and mother worked all week to plan for this meal. God knows I pay enough for Dr. Lebrun to-”<br/><span></span>\
					Just then the doorbell rang, cutting him off, and Libby’s expression changed as quickly as a bipolar transistor.<br/><span></span>\
\
				Gregory was blond and the salad was kale. The leaves’ ruffled edges displayed a hyperbolic geometry such that the two dimensional surface exhibited an extra dimensionality. The distance between points changed depending on which scale one was measuring in. How long was the British coastline? Just like kale.<br/><span></span>\
				 “Just,” they said. “Just, just.”<br/><span></span>\
				She was about to point this out to table when Gregory addressed her first.<br/><span></span>\
					“So what is it you do.” He stated it rather than asked, his tone the patronizing one of a young man used to having people listen and pander to him and not vice versa. Frances could tell that he was trying and failing to look at her face and not at her chemically burned hair or her right breast. <br/><span></span>\
				Libby’s lips tightened and she laid a hand on Gregory’s wrist. “I already mentioned your work at MIT,” she told Frances, in a way that begged for her not to contribute.<br/><span></span>\
				Gregory gave Libby an appeasing smile. “Of course, my dear, but I wanted know what that means, for a woman.”<br/><span></span>\
					Frances would make Libby proud. <br/><span></span>\
				“Oh I just work with bras all day,” she said. “Hah!” she giggled. <br/><span></span>\
					Gregory gave a polite cough. “Do you.” A statement. <br/><span></span>\
				Libby looked into her salad as though wishing she could burrow into and escape through to Russia.<br/><span></span>\
				“Witty,” one said. <br/><span></span>\
				“The coast of England,” said another.<br/><span></span>\
				Perhaps it required further explanation.<br/><span></span>\
				“Bras, as in ‘bra’-‘ket’,” Frances added. “So it’s Dirac Notation, used to define vectors and operators in quantum mechanics, but also as in brassieres.”<br/><span></span>\
				She paused, waiting for the appreciative laughter but none appeared to be forthcoming. Gregory was slicing a sliver of radish in half, eyebrows raised.<br/><span></span>\
				“You’ll have to excuse Frances,” said Father, his bald patch shimmering apologetically. “She is receiving help with−”<br/><span></span>\
				But mother stood up and interrupted him. “Why don’t I get the duck out the oven, dear?” Everyone but Frances agreed that this was a lovely idea.<br/><span></span>\
				“Rice,” one said when the platter came out. Infinitely better than noodles.<br/><span></span>\
				Frances busied herself for a while by sifting through the grains, sorting out the ones that had black at their tips and aligning the others in a binary cipher. The duck lay in an oily pile towards the top of the plate where it would go untouched.<br/><span></span>\
				“One left out at the eighth bit,” they would periodically correct.<br/><span></span>\
				She had almost finished spelling out the third message, a phrase from Popper, when Mother spooned another indiscriminate helping onto the key, rendering the messages inoperable and creating a sorting incongruence. She was about to follow up with a bundle of baby asparagus but Frances yelped and batted her hand away, which collided with the Merlot. <br/><span></span>\
				Wine splashed onto Gregory’s plate of duck, and a deep stain the color of clotted blood spread across the table as though determined to make it past the basket of dinner rolls. <br/><span></span>\
				“Frances!” Father boomed, his navy silk bowtie straining against the large veins in his neck. Libby’s pleading expression apparently made him reconsider and he merely rose and stood uncomfortably, teeth gritted.<br/><span></span>\
				Gregory took it as an excuse to be gallant. “Such fine wine, it couldn’t contain itself,” he said, dabbing a linen napkin to a fleck on his shirt.<br/><span></span>\
				Libby laughed in a high-pitched hysterical way as though Gregory had said something humorous and Mother excused herself three times before getting up to find a replacement plate and some club soda. Frances knew the words would come later. A quick retreat to the shed would be necessary.<br/><span></span>\
					Through the remainder of the meal, Frances kept her eyes on her food, listening to her voices whisper about the geometry of the energy density function and wishing Mother hadn’t taken away the kale. Gregory did not address her again and neither did Mother or Father. <br/><span></span>\
					The others were into the flan and the dessert wine and Gregory was explaining the management structure of his company when they heard the sirens.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
					She was not sure how the fire started. It could have been the magnesium but it could have also been the ammonium perchlorate, the butanone peroxide, the DDNP, or any one of the organic azides. In the end everything burned, one mini explosion after another as the lids on the more combustible compounds melted or shattered off. The little shed, the spread of aspen trees, and one side of the Petrarchs’ colonial just on the other side of the fence were already being eaten away by the fiery plasma. <br/><span></span>\
				Four-year-old Oliver Petrarch stood out on the street in his pajamas, holding a stuffed rabbit by its partly detached ear.<br/><br/><span></span>\
					<br/><span></span>\
					The search through the remnants of the shed resulted in another search through Frances’s records, which resulted in corresponding searches of her office at MIT and of her one bedroom apartment in Boston. Law enforcement officers appeared unconvinced that radioactive uranium and thorium were effectively contained in nested safe-deposit boxes or that tetrahydrofuran was a natural thing to store with kitchen condiments. <br/><span></span>\
					In the shed she’d been experimenting with photo catalysis is what she told the judge. The apartment was fission breeder reactions. Just a hobby, what was wrong with that?<br/><span></span>\
				The letters of warning that went ignored, well she could hardly be blamed for those. She was a physicist after all and not one person from the government agency had actually bothered to visit. Yet apparently three of the letters had been court summons. <br/><span></span>\
				The molybdenum disulfide? It wasn’t for anything, no, but had you ever seen a more interesting crystal structure? <br/><span></span>\
				They hadn’t.<br/><span></span>\
				The expensive lawyer with translucent hair and hardly any facial color that Father hired directed her to be quiet. He pleaded mental instability. He told the courtroom about <i>them</i>. Only Jim had known about <i>them</i>.<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
					“It’s not like it used to be,” Mother said as they stood before the tall metal door in the fading light of day. She said she was sorry over and over, that she hadn’t wanted for this to happen, but that this might be good for Frances, that this might finally help. There was an officer of the court there to ensure that nothing went amiss. <br/><span></span>\
				“They have new treatments,” Mother added. “Treatments that work.”<br/><span></span>\
					Jim was there too though Frances could not imagine why. His ugly face shone with devotion. His genes would not be passed on to future generations. <br/><span></span>\
				“The twenty-sixth digit of pi is three,” one said rather unhelpfully.<br/><span></span>\
				“You’ll get medicine,” Jim said. “It will help with the voices.”<br/><span></span>\
				Frances turned away, and she knew then that she would never look at him again. The stars would be visible soon.<br/><span></span>\
					“This is what the judge agreed to,” said her mother. “Just ten months. It’s this or jail.”<br/><span></span>\
					“The twenty-eighth digit of pi is two.”<br/><span></span>\
				MIT had made itself woefully clear about its estimation of postdocs who served jail sentences. Though what was the difference really, except that jail probably had a better library and more interesting inhabitants. <br/><span></span>\
				Over Mother’s shoulder, Sirius was poking out from the gloom of twilight. <br/><span></span>\
				“Sirius doesn’t care,” the voices said. “The eighty-first digit of pi-”<br/><br/><span></span>\
\
					White-robed nurses gave her pills and watched as she swallowed. Pills full of metals in concentrations never meant to coexist with the human metabolism. They toyed with her conductance.<br/><span></span>\
				In the seventy-third hour and twenty-seventh minute her hand shook too badly for the spoonful of chocolate pudding to execute a successful flight from the plastic cup to her open mouth. Instead it gave an indecent waver, before an especially large tremor displaced it too far from equilibrium, and the system decayed exponentially to land in a fecal smear on her cotton gown. <br/><span></span>\
					By one hundred and three hours she could only remember the first eleven digits of pi. <br/><span></span>\
					Mother came once, in the second week. Libby and Gregory were engaged, wasn’t that great? The wedding would be in September.<br/><span></span>\
					“Great,” one said. It spoke very quietly.<br/><span></span>\
				After that, many more days passed without any external visitors. <br/><span></span>\
\
					“Wake up,” one said. <br/><span></span>\
				Frances opened her eyes. The room was shrouded in darkness except for the light that slunk in beneath the door. But the voice did not reveal the limits of an integral or a resolution to a paradox, or present a potential step in a proof. That happened less and less.<br/><span></span>\
					“What is it?” she asked. Her voice was thick from disuse. <br/><span></span>\
					“The door,” one replied. “It did not click when the nurse walked out.” <br/><span></span>\
				She hadn’t heard the click either. <br/><span></span>\
				She slid out from between the thin sheets and onto the linoleum floor.<br/><span></span>\
				Her amorphous grey nightgown billowed as she padded barefooted down the empty corridor, a medicated angel. <br/><span></span>\
				But where to? <br/><span></span>\
				The walls were blank and inviting, like a sheet of paper. How she would like a pen; they had taken hers away after she had written on the walls of her room. She couldn’t ask for one though, not now. They would know she was out of bed and would send her back to her room. They wouldn’t forget to lock the door. She would be given medicine. <br/><span></span>\
				Life was but a dream. <br/><span></span>\
				“The stairs!”  they said. “The stairs, the stars. Sic itur ad astra.”<br/><span></span>\
				Of course the stairs. Always the stars, the stars in whose colossal dynamos of blazing fusion the atoms of her every breath and her every cell had been born. It had been eight hundred and ninety-seven and a half hours since she had seen the stars. <br/><span></span>\
				She couldn’t remember how many flights of stairs there were between her and the roof of the building but suddenly she was there with the cool night air pressing on her face. The air that also came from stars. There too was Jupiter and its jewel bright moons she knew existed but could not see without her telescope. <br/><span></span>\
				Was it enough just to know? <br/><span></span>\
				Perhaps. It had been enough for Galileo.<br/><span></span>\
				And the stars, crowded out in places by streetlights but so much more present for the journey their photons had taken. Photons from Arcturus, propagating across thirty-six point seven (plus or minus point three) light years, to pass through a lens of proteinatious liquid perfectly adjusted to focus the incoherent parallel infinity of starlight. <br/><span></span>\
				She stepped towards the western edge of the roof to watch the setting sliver of moon. The earth twisted angrily away from its satellite. <br/><span></span>\
				Still no one had come for her. She knew where the Milky Way was in the sky, and though she couldn’t see it through the haze of streetlamps she could feel the particles of light hitting her. She was warmed infinitesimally.<br/><span></span>\
				“One more step,” they said. <br/><span></span>\
				One more step, she agreed.<br/><span></span>\
				That was all it would take to join the quiet light of the galaxy.",
